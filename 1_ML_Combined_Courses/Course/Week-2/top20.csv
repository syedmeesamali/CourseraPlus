18081,50.916705481673745,"Infantino Wrap and Tie Baby Carrier, Black Blueberries","I bought this carrier when my daughter was about 4 weeks old; she's now 10 weeks old.  I had a Moby that I borrowed from a friend but could never quite get to work, and my daughter hated being in it.  I also have a Bjorn Active, but she seemed pretty precarious in that when she was so little.This carrier is nearly perfect for infants.  It's not quite as easy to put on as the Bjorn, but MUCH easier than the Moby, and it gives that nice snug fit that the Moby did.  It's much lighter weight than the Bjorn, so it's easier on my back.  I have the khaki-colored version, so I haven't had any problems with it showing dirt and dust.  I wish the straps weren't so long (one size fits all), but I just wrap them around to my back and tie them again loosely.  [I'm 5'4"" and 145 lbs.]  I think this carrier would fit most people.  The fabric is thick, and the construction seems to be of good quality. It might be hot in hot weather, but most carriers are.This has been a life saver.  My daughter won't sleep anywhere except while being held.  Now, once she's fed/diapered/etc and getting fussy (i.e., needs to sleep), I pop her in and walk around and sing.  After a couple of minutes of fussing, she is sound asleep, sometimes for several hours.  I can do a little light work around the house, plus I can sit and type at the computer (she's in the wrap right now).*******Update 8/1/2010--my daughter is now almost 5 months old, and this carrier still works great with her facing me for her naps.  She now weighs about 15 lbs, and it's not bad for a couple hours of use (especially if I can sit for part of the time).  She starts to strain my back when I have to walk around with her for a couple of hours, but less so than when she is forward-facing in the Bjorn Active.I have tried the face-out option, and it works OK, but I probable prefer to face her out in the Bjorn Active (it's quicker to put on).  The Wrap and Tie is a little tall for her facing out, so I have to try to scrunch down the front, and I worry about her falling asleep and having her nose down in it.  This carrier is definitely better than the Bjorn Active for facing-in naps (more support on the back of her neck so that her head doesn't flop around while she's sleeping).  A friend is sending me her Ergo, so I will compare all three once I've tried it.********Update 8/25/2010--Once I got the Ergo, I stopped using the Wrap and Tie.  Both hold the baby snug and close to me, facing in, for sleeping.  The Ergo is super easy to put on and great for my back.  I am now an Ergo convert.In summary---1) Infantino Wrap and Tie:  Pros = Great for little ones, facing in, for sleeping.  Easier to put on than the Moby and yet keeps baby nice and snug.  Can face baby out.  Sturdy.  Cheap (cheaper than other mei tai style carriers).  Not bad on my back.  Can ball it up and shove it in the diaper bag.  Cons = harder to put on than Bjorn/Ergo, not as good as the Bjorn for facing out, not as good on the back as the Ergo.2) Baby Bjorn (I have the Bjorn Active): Pros = My baby LOVES facing out when awake, and this is hands-down the best carrier for that.  I put up with back pain to keep my baby happy.  Cons: Not as good as the Wrap and Tie or Ergo for facing in/sleeping.  Hurts my back to wear it for long (baby now ~15 lbs).  Expensive.3) Ergo: Pros = Quick and easy to put on, perfect for baby facing in/sleeping, cute little hood to put over her head to block out light while sleeping, AWESOME!!!! for my back.  Cons = Expensive, baby can't face out.  (My baby doesn't much like facing in while awake but she's getting used to it.)When I go out, I usually take both the Ergo and the Bjorn with me in the car, and then pick whichever one is appropriate for my baby at the moment.  If you have enough cash to drop on both (or better yet, can get them used or hand-me-down), get both and skip the Wrap and Tie.  If you only have enough $ for one carrier, the Wrap and Tie might work.*****final update--others have commented on the baby's face being smushed into their chest in the facing-in position.  I haven't had a problem with this, but I frequently check my baby's neck position to make sure that her chin is tilted up a bit and her nose is pointing up a bit.  It's easy to look down at her and reposition her head when appropriate.  Also, I usually have her in with the binky in her mouth, which keeps her face off my chest as well.",5,I bought this carrier when my daughter was about 4 weeks old shes now 10 weeks old  I had a Moby that I borrowed from a friend but could never quite get to work and my daughter hated being in it  I also have a Bjorn Active but she seemed pretty precarious in that when she was so littleThis carrier is nearly perfect for infants  Its not quite as easy to put on as the Bjorn but MUCH easier than the Moby and it gives that nice snug fit that the Moby did  Its much lighter weight than the Bjorn so its easier on my back  I have the khakicolored version so I havent had any problems with it showing dirt and dust  I wish the straps werent so long one size fits all but I just wrap them around to my back and tie them again loosely  Im 54 and 145 lbs  I think this carrier would fit most people  The fabric is thick and the construction seems to be of good quality It might be hot in hot weather but most carriers areThis has been a life saver  My daughter wont sleep anywhere except while being held  Now once shes feddiaperedetc and getting fussy ie needs to sleep I pop her in and walk around and sing  After a couple of minutes of fussing she is sound asleep sometimes for several hours  I can do a little light work around the house plus I can sit and type at the computer shes in the wrap right nowUpdate 812010my daughter is now almost 5 months old and this carrier still works great with her facing me for her naps  She now weighs about 15 lbs and its not bad for a couple hours of use especially if I can sit for part of the time  She starts to strain my back when I have to walk around with her for a couple of hours but less so than when she is forwardfacing in the Bjorn ActiveI have tried the faceout option and it works OK but I probable prefer to face her out in the Bjorn Active its quicker to put on  The Wrap and Tie is a little tall for her facing out so I have to try to scrunch down the front and I worry about her falling asleep and having her nose down in it  This carrier is definitely better than the Bjorn Active for facingin naps more support on the back of her neck so that her head doesnt flop around while shes sleeping  A friend is sending me her Ergo so I will compare all three once Ive tried itUpdate 8252010Once I got the Ergo I stopped using the Wrap and Tie  Both hold the baby snug and close to me facing in for sleeping  The Ergo is super easy to put on and great for my back  I am now an Ergo convertIn summary1 Infantino Wrap and Tie  Pros  Great for little ones facing in for sleeping  Easier to put on than the Moby and yet keeps baby nice and snug  Can face baby out  Sturdy  Cheap cheaper than other mei tai style carriers  Not bad on my back  Can ball it up and shove it in the diaper bag  Cons  harder to put on than BjornErgo not as good as the Bjorn for facing out not as good on the back as the Ergo2 Baby Bjorn I have the Bjorn Active Pros  My baby LOVES facing out when awake and this is handsdown the best carrier for that  I put up with back pain to keep my baby happy  Cons Not as good as the Wrap and Tie or Ergo for facing insleeping  Hurts my back to wear it for long baby now 15 lbs  Expensive3 Ergo Pros  Quick and easy to put on perfect for baby facing insleeping cute little hood to put over her head to block out light while sleeping AWESOME for my back  Cons  Expensive baby cant face out  My baby doesnt much like facing in while awake but shes getting used to itWhen I go out I usually take both the Ergo and the Bjorn with me in the car and then pick whichever one is appropriate for my baby at the moment  If you have enough cash to drop on both or better yet can get them used or handmedown get both and skip the Wrap and Tie  If you only have enough  for one carrier the Wrap and Tie might workfinal updateothers have commented on the babys face being smushed into their chest in the facingin position  I havent had a problem with this but I frequently check my babys neck position to make sure that her chin is tilted up a bit and her nose is pointing up a bit  Its easy to look down at her and reposition her head when appropriate  Also I usually have her in with the binky in her mouth which keeps her face off my chest as well,1
15702,46.098225617909776,Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center,"I am so HAPPY I brought this item for my 7 months old granddaughter. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!! I love it too, she is a little einstein herself and she loves this discovery center. It is full of entertaining fun, and keeps her busy when I need a break to do other things around the house or cook or whatever. I take time also to help her learn the different activities it has. She love the panda bears seesaw and the leaf with the teether rings she bites that thing like CRAZY as much as the blue flexy teething ring. She already knows how to take them off to use it. She also like the penquin spin ball and the spinning parrot bird. She still learning about how to hit the drum that is in front of the lion. The only complaint I have about the puppet lion is they should make it more removable to be taking off and on. She had a tough time to reach out to touch it, so had to find away to detach it off so she can also have a chance to play with that now. I place it back on the pole with she not playing with it, I use it as a puppet to play and tease her with she loves it. She also loves the 3 bi colored chipped rings that moves from one side to another which helps with colors and number learning. Most of all she loves the little music box that has 3 variety of music to listen to, from classical to mumba it sound like, ha ha she already learning how to dance to the tunes and I love to dance with her also. It also has three levels to raise higher and to choose from, and it spins and turn in all directions for her to play with any of the activities, GREAT! What tickles me the most is my son HER DAD, said to me a couple of weeks ago, ""Mom, I need a Baby Einstein too, because I always holding her and I need to do my things too."" I laughed and said ""Why do you think I brought this particular activity center to help her with her motor and learning skills and to keep her busy when I need to do my things around the home."" In one word ""FANTASTIC"" work Baby Einstein Manufacturer Company, GREAT WORK on this product. I will be looking to purchase more Baby Einstein products in the near future. One of my girlfriends mentioned she will keep this product in mind as a baby gift if she needs one in the future due to my recommendation and baby stories I shared with her. I told her come to Amazon for good products and a good buying price, you can't lose here. I have another favorite place I like to buy things from, and when I can't find what I want there, I always come here now, Amazon is my other favorite place to buy now. Good quality with good prices and steals.

30582,44.39033267059594,"Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller, Grapeade","Graco's FastAction Jogging Stroller definitely gives other brands such as Phil and Teds and BOB a run for the money.  There are a lot of things to like about this stroller, with a few cons - but these cons are highly subjective (you'll see why later in the review).  I experimented running with this stroller with both my kids (a little over 30 lb 3 year old and a 40 something pound 5 year old).  I did not test this stroller with the FastAction carseat.  Here's a quick overview before I delve more into detail about the pros and cons of this stroller:Set up for the stroller was fairly straight forward, and most items on the stroller were preassembled.  Each item would loudly click into place, so you'll know if a piece is in or not.  The only piece I had a little difficulty inserting was the kickstand piece.  This piece requires you to snap a plastic piece on a metal bar on the underside of the stroller - thankfully my husband had no problem pushing that piece in!  Disassembly is also very easy - many of the components can be removed by pushing a button and pulling the component out.  Some pieces are optional (arm rests for the kids, kid tray, and parent tray).  The parent tray includes a spot to securely hold you cell phone in both a horizontal or vertical orientation, as well as an closeable compartment for keys, chapsticks, GUs, etc.  There is an arm tether strap attached to the bottom storage basket area, in case you want added security when running down hills.Each brake can be locked individually on the back tires.  There is a huge storage basket that is made out of fabric, so you can store towels, diaper bag, diapers, water bottles, and other sundry items.  The seat is adjustable to 3 positions - fully sitting up, partially reclining, and lying down.  Adjusting the seat is very easy - simply push the seat up until it clicks to get the seat in an upright position, then squeeze two bars located on the back of the seat to recline.  To collapse the stroller, you just pull up on a strap located in the crease on the child's seat.  To assemble, just unlatch the large plastic clip on the side of the seat and lift the stroller's handlebar upwards.  Folding and  down really took minimal effort.PROSThe WheelsWith an air filled 12"" diameter bicycle wheel in the front, and a pair of air filled 16"" diameter bicycle wheels in the rear, the wheels allow for a smoother ride for the child.  When taking my kid out for a run in the park, the ride seemed smooth with very few bumps.  This stroller would be great for running on jogging trails and for going over rougher terrain.  The distance from wheel to foot is also good.  Because the handlebars are set further back, I had no issues with bumping the basket or wheels on the stroller while running.Good ControlControl is a huge issue when maneuvering anywhere with a stroller - even when not running.  I found that I was able to maneuver this stroller easily when running, and had an equally easy time when just rolling with this stroller through the zoo, where slightly smaller aisles are sometimes.  The front wheel allows for good turns, and unlike the Phil and Ted's Sports V.2, we didn't have issues with a locked wheel on smooth surfaces like linoleum.The CanopyThis canopy is awesome.  The canopy is large, has a closeable flap parent view window (uses mesh to look through instead of plastic, and can be covered with more material so no light goes down), and has mesh openings on the sides so the kids can see to the sides of them without having to lean forward to look around the canopy.  Our old Phil and Ted Sports stroller didn't even cover half the amount that this canopy does.  If you happen to have a carseat clicked into place, this canopy would allow for full coverage of the top of the carseat/stroller, and because of the mesh sides, your kid will be able to breath easy and have a little diffused light going in, just so you can keep an eye on him/her.The Parent TrayThis is the first parent tray I've seen that actually has the parent in mind.  There are two cup holders for drinks - to go coffee cups, water bottles, soda cans, and so forth will fit in there fine without fear of tippage.  The cup holders are deep, and are made of rigid plastic.  The smartphone/iPod holder is a nice touch.  With many parents using apps like Runkeeper, iFit, etc on their phones to track mileage, it was about time that someone put a designated holder for the phone.  There is a spring loaded bar that will hold the phone in place.  Underneath the phone holder is a compartment for all those other items you want to bring, but don't necessarily want in plain view for everyone.  I was able to stow my keys, my phone, a small wallet, and a pack of candy I didn't want the kids to see in there.  This is probably the best thing about the parent tray - I can keep my stuff close at hand without having to resort to using the cup holders to hold everything.Storage BasketWhile made of mesh sides and nylon material for the bottom, this basket is quite durable.  You can easily stow a diaper bag in there, or in my case a bunch of jackets, bags of snacks, and my purse in there. When we took this stroller to the zoo, we were able to stow our full Case Logic dSLR camera backpack in the storage basket with enough room to spare for an extra jacket for each of my two kids, as well as a couple of small snacks.  This would be a good stroller to take along for long hikes.The Kickstand and Setup/Fold downMost strollers are like puzzles when setting up and breaking down.  You have to take multiple steps and push multiple buttons in the correct sequence to get it up or down.  This stroller really is the easiest to set up a break down.  Unlock one latch and lift up handlebar to set up, and pull one handle and lift up to break down.  The kickstand is the best thing about the whole breakdown process...when you pull the handle up, the stroller folds and the kickstand keeps it in the upright position.  This means that when your stroller is folded, you don't have to tip it over gently to lay it down on the floor, then later bend over to pick it up off the floor.  My husband raved about this, simply because he was the one who usually has to load this in the car, and bending over to pick up a 30 something pound stroller isn't fun.Huge Buttons to Remove the Wheels/Armrests/Trays/EtcI hate having to search under, under, behind, etc to find those tiny little metal ""buttons"" to push into the plastic in order to release the wheels and other pieces from a stroller.  I hate having to use a screwdriver to push pieces in because my fingers are just too fat/delicate to mash those buttons in.  Thank you Graco, for making those release buttons HUGE and easily accessible.  Now I can take off those extra pieces when I need to without having to struggle.  Best part - just because the buttons are huge doesn't mean than pieces will accidently get triggered and fall off.  You still need to work to remove pieces - just not insanely hard to do so.The FabricIt's easily spot cleaned and durable.  What's not to like?  From what I've seen, it doesn't stain easily, either.The FootrestNormally I wouldn't include this in a review, however, Graco really got something really right with this footrest.  It's all rigid plastic, with a small dotted texture for grip.  This allows for easy cleanup.  The other thing I like about it is that it's not this huge blocky footrest like the old Graco systems.  It's just large enough for my kids to rest their feet, but not so large that it's bumping into everything when I happen to use this stroller in smaller spaces.CONSNonadjustable Height for HandlebarAt a lofty 5' tall, this is a slightly difficult stroller for me to maneuver.  Because the handlebar is part of one long bar that extends down the side of the stroller, there is no way to adjust the bar up or down.  When I hold onto the handlebars, my hands are positioned at about chest level - not a terrible position, but not entirely comfortable either.  When the canopy is up, I cannot see directly in front of the stroller wheel, and therefore have a tough time gauging how far I have in front of me before bumping into something.  For taller people, this won't be an issue.  My husband, who is 5'7"" didn't have a problem with the bar height.Cellphone HolderIf you have an iPhone 5 with a case on, or any phone larger than an iPhone 5, your phone will NOT fit well in the cell holder.  I tested out the phone holder with both the case on and off my phone (I have a Belkin Clear Case on my phoneBelkin View Case / Cover For New Apple iPhone 5 (Black)) and my phone would not fit in either the vertical or horizontal orientation.  When I remove the case, the phone fit fine in the horizontal orientation, but was a very VERY tight fit for the vertical orientation - the iPhone 5 is just too tall.  My friend just laughed when he saw the opening and didn't even try to put his Samsung Galaxy in there.  iPhone 4s, iPods, and other smaller phones will fit in there, just fine.Weight & SizeI found this stroller to be too heavy to want to lug in and out of the car.  It practically takes up the entire trunk of my Prius (that said, Prius trunks are not very big), and to get maximum fold down, you have to take off the kid tray.  However, my husband and I agree that if you are going on a day trip with the kids/going on holiday with the kids, this stroller is totally worth is - Disneyland or the zoo is 100% more enjoyable when you don't have to haul all the kid's bags on your back, and the kids can relax a little in the stroller.  But again, at 5', this thing is a bear for me to get in and out of the car.  Most people probably won't have a problem with this, but I certain did.All in all, I really like this stroller.  The biggest cons I have with the stroller really are because I'm short - for most people who average out at 5'4 for women and 5'10 for men (according to Google), this stroller is parent perfect.  It has a lot of great features for both the child and parent.

This pram is so great I've decided to give my opinion on it.First of all let me notice that I can't imagine how to raise kids without pram. I have three kids and it was the most useful and practical purchase for baby I made (even I paid a fortune for it back then). I used it everyday all year around. When you have kids specially newborns and toddlers, you don't get much excise plus I was getting really tired staying at home. So, I compensated it by long walks around neighborhood with our first baby and then taking toddlers to playground or for a walk while baby was sleeping in pram or I would just sent helper out with kids and enjoy some quite time at home.Let me tell you one thing that out weights everything else: babies sleep much better outside then inside, at home. I guess the fresh air and a lot of oxygen make the trick...so, whenever it was possible I took them outside. I was not happy using a car seat or other strollers for that as I worried about their back and spine. The pram from other side keeps their back in correct position as it has flat and firm bottom. I think none of the strollers that you convert from one position to another provides such a nice flat surface for baby, specially for newborns, to sleep soundly for few hours.. When our first daughter got bigger we used this pram with seat unit and visited a lot of places like zoo, botanic garden and parks. The amortization is great and it gives very smooth ride, while kids in other strollers were trembling all the way.Here are few things I really love about this pram:- Smart  It has the smoothest ride on bouncy sidewalks and park trails  I guess it is because of pram's suspension and large air pumped wheels- Bassinet is large enough that I use it for quite long time. It even fits now my 5 months old in snowsuit bundled in wool sleeping bag and there is some space left...Folded chassis. You can detach bassinet/seat unit and fold the chassis just in few minutes. Cargo of our sedan provides enough space to put chassis and seat there (the bassinet is too high to put into the cargo with chassis). We also used to detach the bassinet with baby sleeping in it and bring it inside (it has handles to carry) when the weather gets really rough or when we have to go home and I don't want to wake her up.- The seat/bassinet can face both ways. It's not so important for bassinet, but very nice for seat unit as babies grow they want to see more and enjoy the ride observing. The back of the seat and the footrest can be adjusted up and down and they can make quite a long flat surface for toddler to sleep.- Rain cover (I paid extra, but looks like its included here) allows you to be safe in any weather condition (I used it during snow and windy time also).- You can easily adjust height of the handle; it was great for us because we (my husband and I) are really different sizes.- The metal basket provides enough space to put some things when you out and it's very convenient. I actually used it to take some toys on playground with us.Bottom line I think Rocco is an excellent pram stroller and I use this pram all the time and I don't know what I would do without it. The only thing I regret they didn't sell it here before...",5,Great Pram RoccoI bought this pram from Europe unfortunately it was not available on Amazon back then and cost me tons of money This pram is so great Ive decided to give my opinion on itFirst of all let me notice that I cant imagine how to raise kids without pram I have three kids and it was the most useful and practical purchase for baby I made even I paid a fortune for it back then I used it everyday all year around When you have kids specially newborns and toddlers you dont get much excise plus I was getting really tired staying at home So I compensated it by long walks around neighborhood with our first baby and then taking toddlers to playground or for a walk while baby was sleeping in pram or I would just sent helper out with kids and enjoy some quite time at homeLet me tell you one thing that out weights everything else babies sleep much better outside then inside at home I guess the fresh air and a lot of oxygen make the trickso whenever it was possible I took them outside I was not happy using a car seat or other strollers for that as I worried about their back and spine The pram from other side keeps their back in correct position as it has flat and firm bottom I think none of the strollers that you convert from one position to another provides such a nice flat surface for baby specially for newborns to sleep soundly for few hours When our first daughter got bigger we used this pram with seat unit and visited a lot of places like zoo botanic garden and parks The amortization is great and it gives very smooth ride while kids in other strollers were trembling all the wayHere are few things I really love about this pram Smart  It has the smoothest ride on bouncy sidewalks and park trails  I guess it is because of prams suspension and large air pumped wheels Bassinet is large enough that I use it for quite long time It even fits now my 5 months old in snowsuit bundled in wool sleeping bag and there is some space leftFolded chassis You can detach bassinetseat unit and fold the chassis just in few minutes Cargo of our sedan provides enough space to put chassis and seat there the bassinet is too high to put into the cargo with chassis We also used to detach the bassinet with baby sleeping in it and bring it inside it has handles to carry when the weather gets really rough or when we have to go home and I dont want to wake her up The seatbassinet can face both ways Its not so important for bassinet but very nice for seat unit as babies grow they want to see more and enjoy the ride observing The back of the seat and the footrest can be adjusted up and down and they can make quite a long flat surface for toddler to sleep Rain cover I paid extra but looks like its included here allows you to be safe in any weather condition I used it during snow and windy time also You can easily adjust height of the handle it was great for us because we my husband and I are really different sizes The metal basket provides enough space to put some things when you out and its very convenient I actually used it to take some toys on playground with usBottom line I think Rocco is an excellent pram stroller and I use this pram all the time and I dont know what I would do without it The only thing I regret they didnt sell it here before,1
24250,40.206645937838786,"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","[I got this stroller for my daughter prior to the birth of her first baby. Here's what she has to say about the B-Agile...]I would give 4.5 stars if I could. I have had the b-agile since my son was born almost eight months ago and, overall, we are very satisfied with this stroller. From my test drives of other strollers and watching my friends struggle with their more complex stroller systems, it seems that every stroller has some issues - but this stroller seems about as good as they come. We use it for long walks through the park, quick errands in the car, and when traveling. I originally wanted the Uppababy Vista - I liked the idea of the bassinet and the seat switching directions. I now know that I would have barely used either of these features and am thankful my father got us this stroller before we splurged on the Vista.Ok, the pros:- The weight. This thing is so light! I easily pull it out of the trunk with one hand when I have groceries or other items in the other.- The foldability. So easy. Hit the button, pull the handle. Love it and do it with one hand all the time. I hear that the safety button isn't on the city mini, so this is an advantage of the b-agile.- The ride/suspension are tops. Smooth and comfortable for baby and mom/dad. Works on all smooth services. Not so great on gravel and grass. Doesn't work on sand.- Maneuverability is great. Also, I believe that the wheel base is narrower than the city mini, so easier to move through tight spaces.- Nice giant canopy- Nice height of handle and walking clearance (I am 5'8, husband is 6')- The combo with the b-safe. This may be the biggest advantage over the city mini. The adaptors come with the stroller, click right into place, and the b-safe car seat snaps in with no effort. It is so easy! The adaptors are also very minimalist, so we just keep them on the stroller at all times and use them when we need them. The car seat adaptors for the city mini for many of the most popular car seats are big, bulky and have to be taken off for folding and, of course, using the stroller independent of the car seat. I know a couple friends that say their car seats are basically balancing on the city mini adaptor and don't feel secure at all. But on the b-agile, the b-safe feels completely solid and secure. I also didn't even think about getting a snap and go because this combo worked so well and, of course, you have all the benefits of an all-purpose stroller with great suspension. This also allowed baby, when tiny, to face me, which was really nice. Finally, the canopy of the b-safe and b-agile work together to cover baby completely when the car seat is installed. For people who really want a complete travel system, I can't imagine a better combo than this.- Contrary to what another review says, my b-agile does stand on its own when folded just fine.- Great travel stroller. Light enough, easy to fold, great travel bag (for purchase separately). One thing to know: you have to remove the car seat adaptors for loading into the travel bag, This isn't a problem for us and adds maybe 30 seconds on the jetway when we are folding our stroller for gate-checking.And the cons:- My brakes are sticky! This is my biggest complaint about this stroller. I frequently have to click and unclick the brakes three or four times for the brakes to release.- The under stroller storage area is a bit cramped. My diaper bag won't fit.- The wheels are hard plastic rather than foam filled. They seem to be holding up thus far, but we'll see...- The seat back doesn't get quite upright enough for my little one.- The unfold latch could be easier. Although the stroller is very light, I can't have baby in one arm, pull the stroller out of the trunk and unfold it. The unfold latch is a little difficult to operate and sometimes you think you've got it and it re-latches. You really need two hands to unfold the stroller - which I am fine with, but I know some folks love the idea of an instant unfold.Also, I bought the sunshine kids console to go with this stroller and it works great. I do not need to remove when folding.No stroller is perfect, but this one is pretty great. This is the only stroller we own and I haven't yet felt a need to get any other type of stroller (including an umbrella). This one fits the bill for a great all-around stroller.",4,I got this stroller for my daughter prior to the birth of her first baby Heres what she has to say about the BAgileI would give 45 stars if I could I have had the bagile since my son was born almost eight months ago and overall we are very satisfied with this stroller From my test drives of other strollers and watching my friends struggle with their more complex stroller systems it seems that every stroller has some issues  but this stroller seems about as good as they come We use it for long walks through the park quick errands in the car and when traveling I originally wanted the Uppababy Vista  I liked the idea of the bassinet and the seat switching directions I now know that I would have barely used either of these features and am thankful my father got us this stroller before we splurged on the VistaOk the pros The weight This thing is so light I easily pull it out of the trunk with one hand when I have groceries or other items in the other The foldability So easy Hit the button pull the handle Love it and do it with one hand all the time I hear that the safety button isnt on the city mini so this is an advantage of the bagile The ridesuspension are tops Smooth and comfortable for baby and momdad Works on all smooth services Not so great on gravel and grass Doesnt work on sand Maneuverability is great Also I believe that the wheel base is narrower than the city mini so easier to move through tight spaces Nice giant canopy Nice height of handle and walking clearance I am 58 husband is 6 The combo with the bsafe This may be the biggest advantage over the city mini The adaptors come with the stroller click right into place and the bsafe car seat snaps in with no effort It is so easy The adaptors are also very minimalist so we just keep them on the stroller at all times and use them when we need them The car seat adaptors for the city mini for many of the most popular car seats are big bulky and have to be taken off for folding and of course using the stroller independent of the car seat I know a couple friends that say their car seats are basically balancing on the city mini adaptor and dont feel secure at all But on the bagile the bsafe feels completely solid and secure I also didnt even think about getting a snap and go because this combo worked so well and of course you have all the benefits of an allpurpose stroller with great suspension This also allowed baby when tiny to face me which was really nice Finally the canopy of the bsafe and bagile work together to cover baby completely when the car seat is installed For people who really want a complete travel system I cant imagine a better combo than this Contrary to what another review says my bagile does stand on its own when folded just fine Great travel stroller Light enough easy to fold great travel bag for purchase separately One thing to know you have to remove the car seat adaptors for loading into the travel bag This isnt a problem for us and adds maybe 30 seconds on the jetway when we are folding our stroller for gatecheckingAnd the cons My brakes are sticky This is my biggest complaint about this stroller I frequently have to click and unclick the brakes three or four times for the brakes to release The under stroller storage area is a bit cramped My diaper bag wont fit The wheels are hard plastic rather than foam filled They seem to be holding up thus far but well see The seat back doesnt get quite upright enough for my little one The unfold latch could be easier Although the stroller is very light I cant have baby in one arm pull the stroller out of the trunk and unfold it The unfold latch is a little difficult to operate and sometimes you think youve got it and it relatches You really need two hands to unfold the stroller  which I am fine with but I know some folks love the idea of an instant unfoldAlso I bought the sunshine kids console to go with this stroller and it works great I do not need to remove when foldingNo stroller is perfect but this one is pretty great This is the only stroller we own and I havent yet felt a need to get any other type of stroller including an umbrella This one fits the bill for a great allaround stroller,1
9530,39.84671767748452,Evenflo X Sport Plus Convenience Stroller - Christina,"After seeing this in Parent's Magazine and reading all the wonderful reviews on Amazon, I decided to get it. It's a GREAT stroller that's hard to beat for only $40 (Christina model)! No bending over when pushing the Sport Plus because the adjustable handles make this stroller a breeze to steer for people of just about any height. Smooth ride, compact with LOTS of features - this stroller is PERFECT for shopping AND vacation trips!It took less than 5 minutes to assemble too! Open the box, take the stroller and the 4 wheels out of the box; open the stroller and flip it over; pop on the four wheels, then flip the stroller back over! Voil&agrave;! It was so easy!!The adjustable handles are a cool feature - something you don't see on many expensive strollers. I'm 5'4"" and my husband is 6'0"" and we don't have to bend over at all to push the stroller. It's is very comfortable for both of us and no more kicking the back wheels! At the mall the other day, we saw a man (who was shorter than my husband) pushing his little boy in an umbrella stroller - the poor guy was hunched completely over!I like the fabric console. It's big enough to hold keys, cell phones, wallets and other small objects. You can leave your purses in the car ladies! The cup holders are nice too - it held my vitamin water (which is wider than a soda can) with no problem.My Skip Hop Saddle Bag (it holds a few diapers, baby wipes, etc.) attaches to the back of the stroller (just under the fabric console) so I can put toys for Serenity in the basket.Serenity is comfortable riding too. She fell fast asleep in it at the Zoo the other day. I like the mesh seat pad and the adjustable canopy - GREAT features for summertime vacation trips!I couldn't decide between this stroller and the Graco IPO Stroller. Both are very attractive, compact, with lots of features. But the IPO is almost twice the price (depending on the model) as the Sport Plus - so that's pretty much what helped me make my choice.I was searching for a nice, well-made, inexpensive, compact stroller and I've found it!It's also a VERY practical baby shower gift too. New Mothers will need a good stroller when they get tired of lugging around those HUGE travel systems!UPDATE (21 July 08): The fabric on the stroller is very easy to clean when it gets dirty. I just used Oxi Clean Laundry Stain Remover to get it looking great again!We used the stroller at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas this past weekend, and just LOVED it. I compared it with the other strollers I saw (and there were TONS - cheap & expensive), and I think my Sport Plus was the best! So did other people - I got lots of stares and compliments!UPDATE (22 April 11): Almost three years old and our stroller is still going strong! I used it recently at Disney and it was so easy quick and easy to fold up for the tram, bus and monorail - it took up very little room. It's disappointing this stroller isn't available anymore. It has such high ratings too! The other one by Evenflo that is similar to this one, Evenflo X Sport (available at Wal-Mart for around this same price I paid for the Plus, $40) isn't nearly as nice and doesn't offer as many features as the Plus. I would've liked to get one for my sister's new baby, but can't since they have been discontinued. Very disappointing.UPDATE (19 April 12): This stroller is STILL going strong! So durable and still in EXCELLENT shape! I can't get over how well this stroller has held up over the years of constant use - VERY well made! Serenity is a 5 now and I recently used it at the Mardi Gras parades and plan to use it at the zoo this Summer. Absolutely the BEST stroller EVER! I really hate that it's not available anymore. I keep checking whenever baby showers come up - this would make such an excellent gift. I'm always getting compliments on it - even after 4 years!",5,After seeing this in Parents Magazine and reading all the wonderful reviews on Amazon I decided to get it Its a GREAT stroller thats hard to beat for only 40 Christina model No bending over when pushing the Sport Plus because the adjustable handles make this stroller a breeze to steer for people of just about any height Smooth ride compact with LOTS of features  this stroller is PERFECT for shopping AND vacation tripsIt took less than 5 minutes to assemble too Open the box take the stroller and the 4 wheels out of the box open the stroller and flip it over pop on the four wheels then flip the stroller back over Voilagrave It was so easyThe adjustable handles are a cool feature  something you dont see on many expensive strollers Im 54 and my husband is 60 and we dont have to bend over at all to push the stroller Its is very comfortable for both of us and no more kicking the back wheels At the mall the other day we saw a man who was shorter than my husband pushing his little boy in an umbrella stroller  the poor guy was hunched completely overI like the fabric console Its big enough to hold keys cell phones wallets and other small objects You can leave your purses in the car ladies The cup holders are nice too  it held my vitamin water which is wider than a soda can with no problemMy Skip Hop Saddle Bag it holds a few diapers baby wipes etc attaches to the back of the stroller just under the fabric console so I can put toys for Serenity in the basketSerenity is comfortable riding too She fell fast asleep in it at the Zoo the other day I like the mesh seat pad and the adjustable canopy  GREAT features for summertime vacation tripsI couldnt decide between this stroller and the Graco IPO Stroller Both are very attractive compact with lots of features But the IPO is almost twice the price depending on the model as the Sport Plus  so thats pretty much what helped me make my choiceI was searching for a nice wellmade inexpensive compact stroller and Ive found itIts also a VERY practical baby shower gift too New Mothers will need a good stroller when they get tired of lugging around those HUGE travel systemsUPDATE 21 July 08 The fabric on the stroller is very easy to clean when it gets dirty I just used Oxi Clean Laundry Stain Remover to get it looking great againWe used the stroller at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas this past weekend and just LOVED it I compared it with the other strollers I saw and there were TONS  cheap  expensive and I think my Sport Plus was the best So did other people  I got lots of stares and complimentsUPDATE 22 April 11 Almost three years old and our stroller is still going strong I used it recently at Disney and it was so easy quick and easy to fold up for the tram bus and monorail  it took up very little room Its disappointing this stroller isnt available anymore It has such high ratings too The other one by Evenflo that is similar to this one Evenflo X Sport available at WalMart for around this same price I paid for the Plus 40 isnt nearly as nice and doesnt offer as many features as the Plus I wouldve liked to get one for my sisters new baby but cant since they have been discontinued Very disappointingUPDATE 19 April 12 This stroller is STILL going strong So durable and still in EXCELLENT shape I cant get over how well this stroller has held up over the years of constant use  VERY well made Serenity is a 5 now and I recently used it at the Mardi Gras parades and plan to use it at the zoo this Summer Absolutely the BEST stroller EVER I really hate that its not available anymore I keep checking whenever baby showers come up  this would make such an excellent gift Im always getting compliments on it  even after 4 years,1
25515,39.6328888293706,"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","I bought this seat for my tall (38in) and thin (28lb) 2 year old daughter. I was impressed with the height the seat allowed for, given that my child will out grow a seat in height long before weight. I needed a seat that would fit in a 2012 Focus and was FAA cerified. The seat is very compact. It was easy to install using the seat belt and the latch. Since the seat is so compact I had enough room to get in the car and put my knee in the seat to help get a solid install. I was able to do this myself in just a few minutes, even in an airport parking lot.My kiddo loved the purple color. That particular color is a micro suede type fabric that is super easy to clean. The wings support her head well when she is sleeping. She can climb in and out of the seat very easily since it is much shorter in rise than her old seat (an Evenflo Symphony). The clips are all great quality and the shoulder pads are nice and soft. She feels less boxed in sitting in this seat. She loves that she can reach things if she drops them next to her seat.I used this seat for air travel shortly after purchase. I found it fairly simple to deal with. I am a 5'5"" woman with a broader frame. I travelled by myself with two kiddos, 2 and 8 years. We did not check anything, we carried all our luggage on. So that fact that this seat can be carried like a backpack was very helpful.Some tips for air travel with this seat:Get two (2) carry straps for the seat so you can wear it as a backpack. This makes the weight easier to bare, is better for your back and keeps your hands free.Have rubber bands handy to roll up extra strap length. The latch straps are very long and can get in the way when trying to install on the plane.Pros:CompactEasy to install (FF, I have not used it RF)Easy to cleanWeight and Height limitsMulitple (up to 4) cup holders can be usedEasy to carry as a backpack for travelCupholders can be removed and washed in the dishwasher if they get icky.Cons:HeavyCup holders can be removed by child (This has never bothered me.)PriceyOverall this is an awesome seat. I'd recommend it to all that can afford it.Diono Radian RXT vs. Britax Frontier 85:If you're like me your decision has probably come down to these two seats. My daughter rides in both seats. I have the Radian in my vehicle (2012 Focus hatchback). My husband has the Frontier in his vehicle (2009 Vibe). She is equally happy with bith seats.My husband and I are pleased with both seats. We have likes and dislikes for each. I'll try to give a good comparision.Seat installation:The Frontier wins here simply because it is lighter.Both seats were super easy to install in either car. The bothe all install well in our 2005 Trailblazer on the odd occassion we use that car. I have never in stalled the Radian RF so I can not comment on that. We use th latch system on both seats. I have also used the belt paths when using in other people's cars. Belt path installation is also easy. The Radian is much heavier than the Frontier, making it more difficult to lift.Seat Maitenance:Here I feel the Radian wins.The cover on the Radian is machine washable and is easily removed. The cover is one piece. The straps do have to be unthreaded to remove the cover. The cup holders can be put in the dishwasher.The cover on the Frontier is supposed to be handwashed- not machine washable. Seriously... hand wash something my kid vomited on. Anyway, my washing machine has a handwash cycle so I used that. It turned out fine. Britax sells the cover for $80. The cup holders are intergrated into the seat so you have to wipe them out.Seat adjustments:It's a tie. Both seats have to be completely remove from the car to make adjustments.The Radian has straps that need to be rethreaded to adjust. But, it's super easy. The crotch strap is easier to move than the Frontier. But, the head wings can be a pain. I have to put my knee in the seat and apply a lot of force to move them. But this means the stay in place once adjusted. When putting a kiddo in the seat the ratchet mechanism to tighten the straps can be annoying. My husband does not care for it.The Frontier has a mechanism on the back that moves the straps and head rest up and dowm. But the adjuster is the piece I always seem to grab when picking up the seat causing the straps to move. I then have to wrangle my daughter to sit in it so I can adjust the straps again. Sort of annoying. Once she is in the seat adjustments are easy. But we didn't like the HUGS. They made her sweat under them so we took them off.Seat size:The Radian is much narrower than the Britax. This could make a big difference if you want to fit 3 across a back seat or have a tiny car. Otherwise It does not matter.Travel:I have only used the Radian for air travel. It is easier to bring into an airport, hands down. I wouldn't even consider air travel with the Frontier.All in all, either seat is a good pick. It will just depend on your needs. I have found I really like them both and would recommend them equally.",5,I bought this seat for my tall 38in and thin 28lb 2 year old daughter I was impressed with the height the seat allowed for given that my child will out grow a seat in height long before weight I needed a seat that would fit in a 2012 Focus and was FAA cerified The seat is very compact It was easy to install using the seat belt and the latch Since the seat is so compact I had enough room to get in the car and put my knee in the seat to help get a solid install I was able to do this myself in just a few minutes even in an airport parking lotMy kiddo loved the purple color That particular color is a micro suede type fabric that is super easy to clean The wings support her head well when she is sleeping She can climb in and out of the seat very easily since it is much shorter in rise than her old seat an Evenflo Symphony The clips are all great quality and the shoulder pads are nice and soft She feels less boxed in sitting in this seat She loves that she can reach things if she drops them next to her seatI used this seat for air travel shortly after purchase I found it fairly simple to deal with I am a 55 woman with a broader frame I travelled by myself with two kiddos 2 and 8 years We did not check anything we carried all our luggage on So that fact that this seat can be carried like a backpack was very helpfulSome tips for air travel with this seatGet two 2 carry straps for the seat so you can wear it as a backpack This makes the weight easier to bare is better for your back and keeps your hands freeHave rubber bands handy to roll up extra strap length The latch straps are very long and can get in the way when trying to install on the planeProsCompactEasy to install FF I have not used it RFEasy to cleanWeight and Height limitsMulitple up to 4 cup holders can be usedEasy to carry as a backpack for travelCupholders can be removed and washed in the dishwasher if they get ickyConsHeavyCup holders can be removed by child This has never bothered mePriceyOverall this is an awesome seat Id recommend it to all that can afford itDiono Radian RXT vs Britax Frontier 85If youre like me your decision has probably come down to these two seats My daughter rides in both seats I have the Radian in my vehicle 2012 Focus hatchback My husband has the Frontier in his vehicle 2009 Vibe She is equally happy with bith seatsMy husband and I are pleased with both seats We have likes and dislikes for each Ill try to give a good comparisionSeat installationThe Frontier wins here simply because it is lighterBoth seats were super easy to install in either car The bothe all install well in our 2005 Trailblazer on the odd occassion we use that car I have never in stalled the Radian RF so I can not comment on that We use th latch system on both seats I have also used the belt paths when using in other peoples cars Belt path installation is also easy The Radian is much heavier than the Frontier making it more difficult to liftSeat MaitenanceHere I feel the Radian winsThe cover on the Radian is machine washable and is easily removed The cover is one piece The straps do have to be unthreaded to remove the cover The cup holders can be put in the dishwasherThe cover on the Frontier is supposed to be handwashed not machine washable Seriously hand wash something my kid vomited on Anyway my washing machine has a handwash cycle so I used that It turned out fine Britax sells the cover for 80 The cup holders are intergrated into the seat so you have to wipe them outSeat adjustmentsIts a tie Both seats have to be completely remove from the car to make adjustmentsThe Radian has straps that need to be rethreaded to adjust But its super easy The crotch strap is easier to move than the Frontier But the head wings can be a pain I have to put my knee in the seat and apply a lot of force to move them But this means the stay in place once adjusted When putting a kiddo in the seat the ratchet mechanism to tighten the straps can be annoying My husband does not care for itThe Frontier has a mechanism on the back that moves the straps and head rest up and dowm But the adjuster is the piece I always seem to grab when picking up the seat causing the straps to move I then have to wrangle my daughter to sit in it so I can adjust the straps again Sort of annoying Once she is in the seat adjustments are easy But we didnt like the HUGS They made her sweat under them so we took them offSeat sizeThe Radian is much narrower than the Britax This could make a big difference if you want to fit 3 across a back seat or have a tiny car Otherwise It does not matterTravelI have only used the Radian for air travel It is easier to bring into an airport hands down I wouldnt even consider air travel with the FrontierAll in all either seat is a good pick It will just depend on your needs I have found I really like them both and would recommend them equally,1
24863,38.001732666146374,Graco Pack 'n Play Element Playard - Flint,"My husband and I assembled this Pack n' Play last night and so far we are very happy with it.  The assembly seemed a bit complicated but I think that's a normal reaction from a couple who has never put together baby gear before.  My husband was able to put it together in about 15-20 minutes and the entire setup seems very sturdy and secure.  The elevated bassinet is also 100% level (we checked with an actual level) and the changer is solid.  I was able to move the Pack n' Play easily and get it through our doors with no issues (it just fit) although I'm almost eight months along.  We haven't had a chance to try the mechanical portion yet as it appears you need to add your own batteries.My only surprise thus far was with the exact color.  The black looks great; I purposely was looking for simple modern colors.  However, I thought the trim color was a beige but it is actually a medium gray.  While I like the clean and simple black coloring of the main section, the gray makes it look a little dark.  Because the dangling stars are gray too, I will probably add a few colorful toys to the overhead bar.Once we have had a chance to use this Pack n' Play, I will update if there are any issues.  All in all, very happy with this item thus far!  Good looking, sturdy, and a great size.Update: We've been using this PnP for a few weeks and it is an essential piece of baby gear in our home.  It is kept by our bed and is used as the baby's night time bassinet until she is old enough to go into her own room in a crib.  We added a folded swaddling blanket on top of the mattress plus an organic sheet for comfort and the baby loves it.  At about three weeks old, she sleeps 4-5 hours in this item.  The changer and basket caddy is also super convenient for middle-of-the-night diaper changes.A minor complaint is since the changer is attached to the PnP on only one side, there is a slight tilting when changing baby but at this point it isn't severe enough to cause a problem.  We also don't find ourselves using the musical attachment however the nightlight is a nice bonus for a quick peek at baby.With regard to the color, I've become a fan of the gray trim color as the neutral tone doesn't distract the baby in the middle of the night and it fits in very nicely with our home decor.  We only use this piece for night time sleeping so this works great for us.",4,My husband and I assembled this Pack n Play last night and so far we are very happy with it  The assembly seemed a bit complicated but I think thats a normal reaction from a couple who has never put together baby gear before  My husband was able to put it together in about 1520 minutes and the entire setup seems very sturdy and secure  The elevated bassinet is also 100 level we checked with an actual level and the changer is solid  I was able to move the Pack n Play easily and get it through our doors with no issues it just fit although Im almost eight months along  We havent had a chance to try the mechanical portion yet as it appears you need to add your own batteriesMy only surprise thus far was with the exact color  The black looks great I purposely was looking for simple modern colors  However I thought the trim color was a beige but it is actually a medium gray  While I like the clean and simple black coloring of the main section the gray makes it look a little dark  Because the dangling stars are gray too I will probably add a few colorful toys to the overhead barOnce we have had a chance to use this Pack n Play I will update if there are any issues  All in all very happy with this item thus far  Good looking sturdy and a great sizeUpdate Weve been using this PnP for a few weeks and it is an essential piece of baby gear in our home  It is kept by our bed and is used as the babys night time bassinet until she is old enough to go into her own room in a crib  We added a folded swaddling blanket on top of the mattress plus an organic sheet for comfort and the baby loves it  At about three weeks old she sleeps 45 hours in this item  The changer and basket caddy is also super convenient for middleofthenight diaper changesA minor complaint is since the changer is attached to the PnP on only one side there is a slight tilting when changing baby but at this point it isnt severe enough to cause a problem  We also dont find ourselves using the musical attachment however the nightlight is a nice bonus for a quick peek at babyWith regard to the color Ive become a fan of the gray trim color as the neutral tone doesnt distract the baby in the middle of the night and it fits in very nicely with our home decor  We only use this piece for night time sleeping so this works great for us,1
20710,35.902962922711176,"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","My husband and I cannot state enough how much we value and appreciate this swing! No amount of money could have provided to us and our baby what this swing has offered!This swing has brought peace, quiet, and happiness to our household! Our newborn baby girl was a bit colicky when she was first born for the first 8 weeks. She would sleep well through the night, but would be fussy and not willing to sleep/nap during the day. She wanted to be rocked to sleep, which left our arms very tired and sore. Well, this swing to the rescue! It puts our little girl to sleep in less than 10 minutes, but not before it thoroughly entertains her with its mirrored surface that the baby faces (She loves it! and coos at it all the time), its wonderful mobile that she loves and even the sounds which she very much appreciates! I also love how the direction of swinging can be changes from front to back or side to side. Our daughter did not care for the side to side motion, but LOVED back to front motion setting!Additionally, the harness is comfortable, safe and easy to use with the baby. The Snuggabunny design is beyond adorable and very comfortable for the baby. It is relatively easy to assemble and set up. The only negative is that it would be difficult to store and takes up a good amount of room. Howver, the benefits highly outweigh this one short coming!I feel that our daugher not only gets to relax and nap better with the swing, the swing is also good for her development, as she learns about her reflection, follows the mobile around, and gets stimulated by a variety of sounds. The multitude of speed settings is also very convenient, as she usually starts swinging at full force, but later we can adjust her to the lowest setting for a more calm sleeping.We decided to purchase a swing on the recommendation of Dr. Harvey Karp (author of Happiest Baby on the Block--a highly recommended book), and it has been wonderful! Well worth the money. I am finding myself to be more and more impressed with Fisher Price as of late as all of the purchased baby products produced by them by us have been great.Our daugher is no longer colicky past 8 weeks of her life (thank you, higher power!), but she still enjoys her swing and loves swinging as we enjoy some peace, quiet, and watching her being so happy and entertained!Our highest recommendations!",5,My husband and I cannot state enough how much we value and appreciate this swing No amount of money could have provided to us and our baby what this swing has offeredThis swing has brought peace quiet and happiness to our household Our newborn baby girl was a bit colicky when she was first born for the first 8 weeks She would sleep well through the night but would be fussy and not willing to sleepnap during the day She wanted to be rocked to sleep which left our arms very tired and sore Well this swing to the rescue It puts our little girl to sleep in less than 10 minutes but not before it thoroughly entertains her with its mirrored surface that the baby faces She loves it and coos at it all the time its wonderful mobile that she loves and even the sounds which she very much appreciates I also love how the direction of swinging can be changes from front to back or side to side Our daughter did not care for the side to side motion but LOVED back to front motion settingAdditionally the harness is comfortable safe and easy to use with the baby The Snuggabunny design is beyond adorable and very comfortable for the baby It is relatively easy to assemble and set up The only negative is that it would be difficult to store and takes up a good amount of room Howver the benefits highly outweigh this one short comingI feel that our daugher not only gets to relax and nap better with the swing the swing is also good for her development as she learns about her reflection follows the mobile around and gets stimulated by a variety of sounds The multitude of speed settings is also very convenient as she usually starts swinging at full force but later we can adjust her to the lowest setting for a more calm sleepingWe decided to purchase a swing on the recommendation of Dr Harvey Karp author of Happiest Baby on the Blocka highly recommended book and it has been wonderful Well worth the money I am finding myself to be more and more impressed with Fisher Price as of late as all of the purchased baby products produced by them by us have been greatOur daugher is no longer colicky past 8 weeks of her life thank you higher power but she still enjoys her swing and loves swinging as we enjoy some peace quiet and watching her being so happy and entertainedOur highest recommendations,1
30483,35.22921837425722,Buttons Cloth Diaper Cover - One Size - 8 Color Options,"We are big Best Bottoms fans here, but I wanted to try these as a cheaper option to designate for daycare use. They are well made, super soft in feel, with gentle waist elastics, and snug leg elastics. The leg elastics initially caused red marks on my super chubby thighed baby, but since he's trimmed down with crawling, that's no longer an issue and I now appreciate the snugger fit.Compared to Best Bottoms, I prefer these for the soft stretchy feel, but still get a better fit with our Best Bottoms (so I tend to reach for the Best Bottoms more often). Best Bottoms give a better fit because they have one additional rise setting (4 instead of just 3 rise options). Fewer rise options on the Buttons inevitably leads to more awkward in-between size stages where one is too snug and the other looks (or really is) huge. Our Best Bottoms always look nice and trim. Buttons do, too, but only when the fit is right, and that is less frequently with the Buttons. We've gotten around the in-between stage by unsnapping the outer two snaps in the rise completely on the Buttons covers to allow more room in the legs, but leaving the middle rise snap snapped down to pull up all the excess material. It still looks a bit sloppy, but it works, and looks / fits better than being 100% on the largest rise.The inserts: We have small, medium, large best bottom inserts in hemp/cotton as well as stay dry. All are compatible with Buttons, although they can be a bit stubborn snapping in, but they do snap in. The larges are a hair big for the Buttons covers in my opinion, but you can make them fit on the largest rise if you need to. I definitely prefer to use the medium Best Bottom inserts or the Buttons large inserts on the middle and large rise with Buttons.The large Buttons inserts we got to try are super soft, seem just as absorbent as our Best Bottoms but more flexible and bunch a bit more, though it's not caused any problems for us. They are in-between the medium and large Best Bottom stay dry sizes. Just as wide at the ends. As wide in the middle as the Best Bottom larges. Wider than the Best Bottom mediums. Just thought I'd share if anyone was wondering how they compare.I'd definitely recommend the Buttons covers and inserts to anyone looking to try an AI2 system at an affordable price-point. Although I still prefer our Best Bottoms, for the price, I'll definitely be adding more Buttons to our stash, especially now that they've added some cool new colors and prints :-)",4,We are big Best Bottoms fans here but I wanted to try these as a cheaper option to designate for daycare use They are well made super soft in feel with gentle waist elastics and snug leg elastics The leg elastics initially caused red marks on my super chubby thighed baby but since hes trimmed down with crawling thats no longer an issue and I now appreciate the snugger fitCompared to Best Bottoms I prefer these for the soft stretchy feel but still get a better fit with our Best Bottoms so I tend to reach for the Best Bottoms more often Best Bottoms give a better fit because they have one additional rise setting 4 instead of just 3 rise options Fewer rise options on the Buttons inevitably leads to more awkward inbetween size stages where one is too snug and the other looks or really is huge Our Best Bottoms always look nice and trim Buttons do too but only when the fit is right and that is less frequently with the Buttons Weve gotten around the inbetween stage by unsnapping the outer two snaps in the rise completely on the Buttons covers to allow more room in the legs but leaving the middle rise snap snapped down to pull up all the excess material It still looks a bit sloppy but it works and looks  fits better than being 100 on the largest riseThe inserts We have small medium large best bottom inserts in hempcotton as well as stay dry All are compatible with Buttons although they can be a bit stubborn snapping in but they do snap in The larges are a hair big for the Buttons covers in my opinion but you can make them fit on the largest rise if you need to I definitely prefer to use the medium Best Bottom inserts or the Buttons large inserts on the middle and large rise with ButtonsThe large Buttons inserts we got to try are super soft seem just as absorbent as our Best Bottoms but more flexible and bunch a bit more though its not caused any problems for us They are inbetween the medium and large Best Bottom stay dry sizes Just as wide at the ends As wide in the middle as the Best Bottom larges Wider than the Best Bottom mediums Just thought Id share if anyone was wondering how they compareId definitely recommend the Buttons covers and inserts to anyone looking to try an AI2 system at an affordable pricepoint Although I still prefer our Best Bottoms for the price Ill definitely be adding more Buttons to our stash especially now that theyve added some cool new colors and prints ,1
32728,34.80647365142949,Mamas &amp; Papas 2014 Urbo2 Stroller - Black,"After much research I purchased an Urbo2. It's exactly what I hoped it would be. For one thing, it's gorgeous- the frame, the fabrics, the leather looking bumper bar and handle- everything. It has great maneuverability and it's easy to push with just one hand even. It's easy to fold and unfold and it's lightweight. The reversible seat is a must for me as my babies always seem to be very happy in a stroller when they can see me. I prefer the handle height all the way extended as I am fairly tall, but I also love that it can telescope down to a very low height which is great for my older kids who love to push the baby as well as for making a more compact stroller in tight places like a restaurant or a bus. The stroller seat is a nice generous size and the padding is the cushiest I've ever seen. Even the strap covers are cushy. The seat sits nice and upright, and I love that it can lay truly flat for long stroller naps. (Because it can lay truly flat it would really be suitable even for a newborn without a bassinet.) The canopy is very large, which is a big plus to me. The basket is not huge but it's surprisingly adequate. Today we fit a small diaper bag in there as well as a couple of kid jackets and a few other small items. We could have gotten even more stuff in there, I'm sure. The suspension on the front wheels is really impressive. It's the best I've ever seen- except maybe for the bugaboo chameleon. I can actually just roll right up over sloped curbs because of it. Not even my UppaBaby Vista can do that! The stroller is really narrow and can fit through a lot of tight spaces. It's significantly more narrow than my Vista. The Urbo2 comes with a rain cover which is neat but I pretty much never use rain covers. The accessory that I like is the nifty sunshade/privacy shade/bug net which is actually tucked right into the foot rest. It's always handy! I think this stroller can handle just about any terrain that a suburbanite or city dweller would encounter- bumpy sidewalks, cobblestone or bricks, stray stones, a patch of grass here and there, etc.There are a few things that would make it a 5 star stroller to me:-Slightly larger wheels. The wheels are adequate and the suspension does make up a good bit for what it lacking in size, but if they were just a bit bigger this stroller could probably tackle anything.-An even larger basket. I just so adore the huge basket on the UppaBaby Vista.-Something on the stroller is creaky sometimes (from day one). I think it might be the wheels? It doesn't seem to be a functional issue thus far, but it just sounds bad. Maybe it's just all the metal parts on this thing? Whatever it is, I could do without it.-If the stroller could be folded with the seat in the parent facing position. Currently the seat must be in the forward facing position to fold the stroller. It's not a huge deal though, because the seat is very easy to reverse. Nonetheless I would love to have the option of leaving the seat parent facing.The bottom line is that this thing is awesome! I would never have purchased the original Urbo because of the lack of suspension and wheel issues I read so much about as well as the smaller basket and the lower, less upright seat. But Mamas & Papas has made some MAJOR improvements with the Urbo2. It's a great and very functional stroller.

2570,34.653655381521396,"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White","I bought the tower despite the bad reviews and so far I think I made a great decision.  I didn't buy it at Babies R Us, but chose another vendor instead that offered free shipping and ended up costing a bit less.  I ordered the tower on 10/28/05 and it arrived 11/23/05, which wasn't a problem since I knew that Stork craft products tend to take awhile to ship, so I ordered early.  The box came in perfect condition and when we took it apart all the pieces where undamaged, in great condition and there was nothing missing.It took my mom and I (I am 5 months pregnant) an hour to put it together, the directions where easy to follow and the assembly was a piece of cake.  The only difficulty is to screw on the back panel.  There were a million screws, so have your electric screwdriver handy.  Also be careful with those screws the tolerances are very close and the wood is soft so is you don't screw them in just right you may end up with screws sticking out.  We simply redid them and now there are a few chips in the back of the tower, nothing to worry about.Upside* Looks absolutely amazing.  The wood is beautiful and shiny, the design is elegant and looks great in the room* The drawers are deep and allow for lots of storage.  Easy to take out and are finished with white on the inside for a very clean and appealing look.* The side cabinet is great.  Shelves can easily come out to allow for larger items to be stored.  Might be a good place for a diaper genie...* Very sturdy and heavy, and as a bonus comes with a wall attachment so that you don't have to worry about it tipping when the little one starts walking.* The top of the tower can be used as a changing table, or you can buy a hatch that can be easily attached for additional storage.* Very easy to assemble, everything is predrilled and the directions are super easy.Downside* The wood is very soft, so you have to be careful during assembly not to chip or damage the pieces.* While most of the tower is very sturdy the back panel is made out of flimsy material and the screws are a pain to use.  In hint sight we should have nailed the back panel.Overall absolutely great product.  Functional and looks really beautiful.  I suggest ordering elsewhere and ordering early, in case there are problems.",5,I bought the tower despite the bad reviews and so far I think I made a great decision  I didnt buy it at Babies R Us but chose another vendor instead that offered free shipping and ended up costing a bit less  I ordered the tower on 102805 and it arrived 112305 which wasnt a problem since I knew that Stork craft products tend to take awhile to ship so I ordered early  The box came in perfect condition and when we took it apart all the pieces where undamaged in great condition and there was nothing missingIt took my mom and I I am 5 months pregnant an hour to put it together the directions where easy to follow and the assembly was a piece of cake  The only difficulty is to screw on the back panel  There were a million screws so have your electric screwdriver handy  Also be careful with those screws the tolerances are very close and the wood is soft so is you dont screw them in just right you may end up with screws sticking out  We simply redid them and now there are a few chips in the back of the tower nothing to worry aboutUpside Looks absolutely amazing  The wood is beautiful and shiny the design is elegant and looks great in the room The drawers are deep and allow for lots of storage  Easy to take out and are finished with white on the inside for a very clean and appealing look The side cabinet is great  Shelves can easily come out to allow for larger items to be stored  Might be a good place for a diaper genie Very sturdy and heavy and as a bonus comes with a wall attachment so that you dont have to worry about it tipping when the little one starts walking The top of the tower can be used as a changing table or you can buy a hatch that can be easily attached for additional storage Very easy to assemble everything is predrilled and the directions are super easyDownside The wood is very soft so you have to be careful during assembly not to chip or damage the pieces While most of the tower is very sturdy the back panel is made out of flimsy material and the screws are a pain to use  In hint sight we should have nailed the back panelOverall absolutely great product  Functional and looks really beautiful  I suggest ordering elsewhere and ordering early in case there are problems,1
26790,34.32733725041887,"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double Stroller, Shadow/Orange","We are well pleased with this stroller, and I would recommend it to others.  The only real problem with this stroller is the lack of cargo space and the difficulty with which the cargo space is accessed.  To accommodate for the lack of access to cargo space, I use stroller hooks to affix my diaper bag to the stroller frame, and I use a mommy hook on the handle to attach any odds and ends.I have not purchased a bar or any trays to go in front of kids, and I'm happy about that.  I think they'd just be in the way, really, and they're not necessary.  I also didn't  purchase the baby seat adapter, but rather, started laying my infant in this stroller for use when he was about 3 months old.  I would have done so earlier if I needed to, but it was winter and I wasn't really using a double stroller while the baby was that little.  I'm glad I saved the expense on those accessories.The stroller does need a parent console.  The best option I've found for that is the bob duallie console.  It's not a perfect fit, but it's adequate and functional.  I also bought the baby jogger stroller bag for use with airline travel and was much more impressed with the travel bag than I had expected to be.The stroller handles well.  It turns on a dime, and there is no problem getting through doors at commercial establishments.  I tried it in my house, and it goes through most interior doorframes as well.  It's good for use at the mall, the park, or bumpy city sidewalks.  It is not, however, a jogging stroller, but it handles multiple types of terrain very well.  It's got lots of space for our toddler, and the separate recline for the baby is great.  The shades are large and I didn't realize before this stroller how nice it is to have such large sunshades.  It's also great that they operate separately. The stroller folds easily, and folds small.  It takes up drastically less trunk space than my single babytrend jogger.  It's also easier to fold and easier to load in and out of my Ford Fusion trunk than the single stroller.  On a recent trip we fit this stroller and two large pieces of luggage along with some smaller items in the trunk of our Ford Fusion.The only complaint is the cargo space.  It seems to me that the design could be modified with only slight adjustments to allow meaningful access to the cargo space.  As it is, the cargo area will hold quite a bit, but nothing that is large.  So, you can put lots of small items in--jackets, lunch bags, half filled duffel bags, but you cannot fit in a full diaper bag or anything of the sort.We got a good deal on this stroller, and I would buy it again and recommend it to others.",4,We are well pleased with this stroller and I would recommend it to others  The only real problem with this stroller is the lack of cargo space and the difficulty with which the cargo space is accessed  To accommodate for the lack of access to cargo space I use stroller hooks to affix my diaper bag to the stroller frame and I use a mommy hook on the handle to attach any odds and endsI have not purchased a bar or any trays to go in front of kids and Im happy about that  I think theyd just be in the way really and theyre not necessary  I also didnt  purchase the baby seat adapter but rather started laying my infant in this stroller for use when he was about 3 months old  I would have done so earlier if I needed to but it was winter and I wasnt really using a double stroller while the baby was that little  Im glad I saved the expense on those accessoriesThe stroller does need a parent console  The best option Ive found for that is the bob duallie console  Its not a perfect fit but its adequate and functional  I also bought the baby jogger stroller bag for use with airline travel and was much more impressed with the travel bag than I had expected to beThe stroller handles well  It turns on a dime and there is no problem getting through doors at commercial establishments  I tried it in my house and it goes through most interior doorframes as well  Its good for use at the mall the park or bumpy city sidewalks  It is not however a jogging stroller but it handles multiple types of terrain very well  Its got lots of space for our toddler and the separate recline for the baby is great  The shades are large and I didnt realize before this stroller how nice it is to have such large sunshades  Its also great that they operate separately The stroller folds easily and folds small  It takes up drastically less trunk space than my single babytrend jogger  Its also easier to fold and easier to load in and out of my Ford Fusion trunk than the single stroller  On a recent trip we fit this stroller and two large pieces of luggage along with some smaller items in the trunk of our Ford FusionThe only complaint is the cargo space  It seems to me that the design could be modified with only slight adjustments to allow meaningful access to the cargo space  As it is the cargo area will hold quite a bit but nothing that is large  So you can put lots of small items injackets lunch bags half filled duffel bags but you cannot fit in a full diaper bag or anything of the sortWe got a good deal on this stroller and I would buy it again and recommend it to others,1
11898,34.07198038504883,"Evenflo 6 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","It's always fun to write a review on those products that not only worked out great but also were a smashing value, to boot.  This, along with the 8 oz version that we also used, is one of those products.When I told my wife how much I loved these bottles, she just shook her head as if to say 'The poor man has gone mental.'  Sure, I may spend more time with my power tools than baby bottles, but I quickly grew fond of feeding my baby daughter and I always appreciate a super product at a great value.  Also, I figure there ought to be some positive side to my initial, terrifying, experience to shopping for feeding supplies.  It was my mission, you see, to get the bottles and accessories necessary for feeding baby when mommy went back to work.  (baby was breastfed and went to the bottle for pumped milk...)  No problem, I thought.  Go to the store, grab some bottles and be home in 20 minutes, I thought.  Whoa.  First time parents, you know what I am talking about:  go into one of those giant baby supply stores and behold the section labeled 'feeding' and there it is - a wall 8 feet high by  40 feet long.  (seemed like 100 feet long at the time)  Shelves and shelves and shelves of JUST bottles, and we're not even talking about nipples.  My wife thought I had instead gone to a bar when I finally got home 4 hours later, exhausted and overwhelmed.  With no bottles.  OK, so the review...We wanted bottles with no BPA, which was beginning to make big news a few years ago, so we explored non-BPA options.  There were plastic ones, but not all of them indicated on the bottle exactly what type of plastic they were.  (you know, PETE, HDPE, LDPE, etc. with those little triangles on the bottom)  That made me unsure of plastic.  Then we considered glass.  Would they break?  Sure, if they were dropped far enough on a hard surface, but we decided we'd be careful.  So, these glass bottles have no BPA.  Another nice benefit is that they also have no printing, so we don't have to worry about what chemicals or heavy metals might also be in the printing.  And, another nice thing about not having any printing is that the printing doesn't wear off after hundreds of feedings and cleanings.  These bottles have their gradations formed right into the glass, so they'll wear out when the bottle wears out.  Which is never.They are colorless.  We like that also.  You can see what's in the bottle, and you can also tell when they are clean.  I mean, there's nothing so clean looking as clear glass with no water spots, right?  We've seen other plastic bottles that were colored or turned cloudy over time, and I don't like not seeing exactly what my baby is drinking.They are durable.  Unless you clean them with steel wool, these bottles won't scratch.  Can't say that about plastic.  They also won't melt, either, when you boil them to sterilize.  BPA-free plastic may be great when it is cold, but I wondered what chemicals they may be releasing at over 212 degrees.  Any glass is breakable, but our daughter didn't break a single one in almost two years.  And she tried.  I found them to be as sturdy, when using and cleaning them, as our drinking glasses.  No parent wants their child to be showered with broken glass, but we came to the conclusion that there was no more to fear from this happening with baby's bottles than with any other glass she is around. (car windows, house windows, drinking glasses, dishes, etc.)  When baby turned to toddler, however, the deal's off, as she likes nothing better than to hurl everything she can hold.  Nowadays it's nothing but titanium plates and bowls for her...Value.  This one's a biggie.  Nothing's too good for my daughter, a sentiment shared by every other parent on earth, I reckon.  But these are reasonable.  You've seen other glass bottles, the ones that ape the 'no BPA' angle, the ones that cost nearly TEN bucks for a measly TWO bottles?  Yikes!  I looked at them, and they're fine bottles, but we're talking value here and these Evenflo bottles win that argument, for me.  Besides, I recall that these bottles came not only with a ring and nipple, but also a top cap, and a seal that goes under the ring so you can shake up formula without spewing it all over the place through the nipple.  (ask me how I know)Other nice things:  These come in common-sense sizes, 4 and 8 ounces.  Also, they happen to fit perfectly Medela breast pump valves - for those of you so inclined - so you can pump directly into the bottle and then pop it in the fridge.  Cool!  (yeah, my wife just loves it when I wax enthusiastic about all this)  Most importantly of all, they worked great for our daughter.  No gas, no fussiness, no issues at all with the nipples, which do vent.  (there's a shallow groove on the base of the nipples that allows air into the bottle if you don't over-tighten the ring)Are these bottles perfect?  Not universally, I'm sure, but they were perfect for us and we'll be using them for our next little one.  One nice thing is that you can always change nipples to another brand if baby likes those best or to a different flow rate if necessary.  (they come with different flow rates??  Who knew?!)",5,Its always fun to write a review on those products that not only worked out great but also were a smashing value to boot  This along with the 8 oz version that we also used is one of those productsWhen I told my wife how much I loved these bottles she just shook her head as if to say The poor man has gone mental  Sure I may spend more time with my power tools than baby bottles but I quickly grew fond of feeding my baby daughter and I always appreciate a super product at a great value  Also I figure there ought to be some positive side to my initial terrifying experience to shopping for feeding supplies  It was my mission you see to get the bottles and accessories necessary for feeding baby when mommy went back to work  baby was breastfed and went to the bottle for pumped milk  No problem I thought  Go to the store grab some bottles and be home in 20 minutes I thought  Whoa  First time parents you know what I am talking about  go into one of those giant baby supply stores and behold the section labeled feeding and there it is  a wall 8 feet high by  40 feet long  seemed like 100 feet long at the time  Shelves and shelves and shelves of JUST bottles and were not even talking about nipples  My wife thought I had instead gone to a bar when I finally got home 4 hours later exhausted and overwhelmed  With no bottles  OK so the reviewWe wanted bottles with no BPA which was beginning to make big news a few years ago so we explored nonBPA options  There were plastic ones but not all of them indicated on the bottle exactly what type of plastic they were  you know PETE HDPE LDPE etc with those little triangles on the bottom  That made me unsure of plastic  Then we considered glass  Would they break  Sure if they were dropped far enough on a hard surface but we decided wed be careful  So these glass bottles have no BPA  Another nice benefit is that they also have no printing so we dont have to worry about what chemicals or heavy metals might also be in the printing  And another nice thing about not having any printing is that the printing doesnt wear off after hundreds of feedings and cleanings  These bottles have their gradations formed right into the glass so theyll wear out when the bottle wears out  Which is neverThey are colorless  We like that also  You can see whats in the bottle and you can also tell when they are clean  I mean theres nothing so clean looking as clear glass with no water spots right  Weve seen other plastic bottles that were colored or turned cloudy over time and I dont like not seeing exactly what my baby is drinkingThey are durable  Unless you clean them with steel wool these bottles wont scratch  Cant say that about plastic  They also wont melt either when you boil them to sterilize  BPAfree plastic may be great when it is cold but I wondered what chemicals they may be releasing at over 212 degrees  Any glass is breakable but our daughter didnt break a single one in almost two years  And she tried  I found them to be as sturdy when using and cleaning them as our drinking glasses  No parent wants their child to be showered with broken glass but we came to the conclusion that there was no more to fear from this happening with babys bottles than with any other glass she is around car windows house windows drinking glasses dishes etc  When baby turned to toddler however the deals off as she likes nothing better than to hurl everything she can hold  Nowadays its nothing but titanium plates and bowls for herValue  This ones a biggie  Nothings too good for my daughter a sentiment shared by every other parent on earth I reckon  But these are reasonable  Youve seen other glass bottles the ones that ape the no BPA angle the ones that cost nearly TEN bucks for a measly TWO bottles  Yikes  I looked at them and theyre fine bottles but were talking value here and these Evenflo bottles win that argument for me  Besides I recall that these bottles came not only with a ring and nipple but also a top cap and a seal that goes under the ring so you can shake up formula without spewing it all over the place through the nipple  ask me how I knowOther nice things  These come in commonsense sizes 4 and 8 ounces  Also they happen to fit perfectly Medela breast pump valves  for those of you so inclined  so you can pump directly into the bottle and then pop it in the fridge  Cool  yeah my wife just loves it when I wax enthusiastic about all this  Most importantly of all they worked great for our daughter  No gas no fussiness no issues at all with the nipples which do vent  theres a shallow groove on the base of the nipples that allows air into the bottle if you dont overtighten the ringAre these bottles perfect  Not universally Im sure but they were perfect for us and well be using them for our next little one  One nice thing is that you can always change nipples to another brand if baby likes those best or to a different flow rate if necessary  they come with different flow rates  Who knew,1
17528,34.06743960949823,Freemie Hands-Free Concealable Breast Pump Collection System,"I absolutely love this product.  I work as a Customer Service rep from my home.  It was so difficult pumping with one hand holding the horn to my breast while typing with the other hand.  Although I use a headset for the telephone, I could only pump one breast at a time due to the need to be able to type with the other hand.  Not sure if it was the nerves or the uncomfortable position I was holding the horn while typing, but I was only able to pump from 2 to 4 oz at a time.  This is 2 to 4 oz for both breasts!  I was really worried I would have to supplement with formula.Looking online for something to increase my milk supply I found a few reviews on Freemie.  I then started purposely looking for reviews on Freemie.  I have to admit I scoffed at a couple of reviews that stated how much their milk supply had increased.  Thought they were definitely exaggerating. You will probably think the same of me, but I can tell you truthfully that my milk supply has gone from 2 to 4 oz to 9 to 10 oz per pumping cycle with both breasts (that's about 4.5 to 5 oz per breast).  My husband had to buy me new milk containers since I am now making enough to freeze my milk.  Before the milk was being put in fridge as baby was drinking faster than I could produce.I am now able to pump a lot more frequently since I can just put them comfortably in my bra and the people I am on the phone with are none the wiser of what I am doing (not that they new with the horns either...lol).  I am more relaxed and not so worried about my typing faster so that I can take care of more calls and not get into issues with my Supervisors.  Another thing I believe has helped with my milk supply is the fact that they are so comfortable.  I'm not sure why (maybe the way I held them to my breast or maybe I needed a bigger size), but the horns were very uncomfortable to me and really made me sore.  I dreaded having to pump.  I noticed from day one with the Freemie that they are a lot more comfortable.  My breast fits it perfectly and no more pain while pumping.That's another thing I wanted to touch upon.  I almost did not purchase the Freemie when reading the one negative review on here.  I have very large breast and was concerned about the fit.  I believe the issue is with nipple size and not breast size since mine fit me perfectly.  My breast form perfectly with the Freemie with no problems.  On the contrary, like I stated before, they are way more comfortable than the horns which do go by breast size and I sometimes wonder if that is why mine hurt so much.The one thing I won't say I do not like, but some might feel differently as it is a bit misguiding to some, is that they do not look natural.  They make my already large breast look huge and with a flat tip since the bottom of Freemie is flat.  Doesn't bother me much since I am working from home and only my children and husband see me pumping.  I have read that wearing a bigger shirt/sweatshirt over your clothes can disguise them some for use in a regular office or car.  I haven't tried it yet though.Well I hope my review has helped someone make a decision in buying the Freemie.  I am a VERY happy customer and highly recommend it.",5,I absolutely love this product  I work as a Customer Service rep from my home  It was so difficult pumping with one hand holding the horn to my breast while typing with the other hand  Although I use a headset for the telephone I could only pump one breast at a time due to the need to be able to type with the other hand  Not sure if it was the nerves or the uncomfortable position I was holding the horn while typing but I was only able to pump from 2 to 4 oz at a time  This is 2 to 4 oz for both breasts  I was really worried I would have to supplement with formulaLooking online for something to increase my milk supply I found a few reviews on Freemie  I then started purposely looking for reviews on Freemie  I have to admit I scoffed at a couple of reviews that stated how much their milk supply had increased  Thought they were definitely exaggerating You will probably think the same of me but I can tell you truthfully that my milk supply has gone from 2 to 4 oz to 9 to 10 oz per pumping cycle with both breasts thats about 45 to 5 oz per breast  My husband had to buy me new milk containers since I am now making enough to freeze my milk  Before the milk was being put in fridge as baby was drinking faster than I could produceI am now able to pump a lot more frequently since I can just put them comfortably in my bra and the people I am on the phone with are none the wiser of what I am doing not that they new with the horns eitherlol  I am more relaxed and not so worried about my typing faster so that I can take care of more calls and not get into issues with my Supervisors  Another thing I believe has helped with my milk supply is the fact that they are so comfortable  Im not sure why maybe the way I held them to my breast or maybe I needed a bigger size but the horns were very uncomfortable to me and really made me sore  I dreaded having to pump  I noticed from day one with the Freemie that they are a lot more comfortable  My breast fits it perfectly and no more pain while pumpingThats another thing I wanted to touch upon  I almost did not purchase the Freemie when reading the one negative review on here  I have very large breast and was concerned about the fit  I believe the issue is with nipple size and not breast size since mine fit me perfectly  My breast form perfectly with the Freemie with no problems  On the contrary like I stated before they are way more comfortable than the horns which do go by breast size and I sometimes wonder if that is why mine hurt so muchThe one thing I wont say I do not like but some might feel differently as it is a bit misguiding to some is that they do not look natural  They make my already large breast look huge and with a flat tip since the bottom of Freemie is flat  Doesnt bother me much since I am working from home and only my children and husband see me pumping  I have read that wearing a bigger shirtsweatshirt over your clothes can disguise them some for use in a regular office or car  I havent tried it yet thoughWell I hope my review has helped someone make a decision in buying the Freemie  I am a VERY happy customer and highly recommend it,1
9100,34.05012238707098,"P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating in Tias, Green","I've purchased both the P'Kolino Little Reader Chair and the P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating and I'm writing this review to hopefully help anyone who is debating between them. I'll initially review each item and will then compare them. The star rating above is specifically for the  P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating.P'Kolino Silly Soft SeatingP'Kolino Silly Soft Seating in Pipa - Blue:I bought the P'Kolino Silly Soft Seating (in orange) for my 1 yr old son hoping he'd use it as a chair but also hoping that he'd enjoy building a tower with it, using it as a table, or whatever else he wanted to do. He very rarely sits on it as a chair but has had a bit of fun pushing the top of it around the house and occasionally throwing some of the pieces. He really enjoys sitting on the base sideways with one leg on each side as if riding a car and scooting around the house (or being pushed on it across the floor). The cover is fleece-like and picks up a lot of dirt easily from our hardwood floors and the foam is softer than I imagined, but it's a cute chair and we like it. While my son did have fun playing with it on occasion, I had hoped he would have shown more interest in it (particularly in sitting on it). This brings me to my 2nd purchase:P'Kolino Little Reader ChairP'Kolino Little Reader Chair in Green:I bought the P'Kolino Little Reader Chair (in orange) for my 17 month old son who loves to read (the same son who was 1 yr old when he got the Silly Soft Seating). He likes to sit in it while reading his books and enjoys putting books in and taking them out of the side pockets. When the product arrived I was surprised to see that the chair is meant for children 2yr+ since I hadn't noticed any mention of this on the Amazon description. I was even more surprised at the size of the Little Reader Chair because it fits my son quite well and he is very petite (~5th percentile). Although it's a small chair, I think it will fit him for a couple of years but I'd be surprised if these chairs were big enough for larger children. The cover is faux-suede and the chair is fairly sturdy (for foam).Little Reader Chair vs. Silly Soft Seating:I like both of these products but for different reasons. If you want a chair for your child that they will sit and read in, I would absolutely get the Little Reader Chair, but if you aren't looking specifically for a chair for your child and would like something more imaginative that they can be creative with, I'd get the Silly Soft Seating. It's much more of a toy than a chair. Also, it's not as sturdy as the little reader but is certainly sturdy enough. I'm glad we have both of these chairs because my son enjoys them but I think in the long run my son will get more use out of the Little Reader Chair.**UPDATE** May 21 2013 **UPDATE**My son is now almost 4 and he still occasionally uses the little reader chair (we keep it next to a bookshelf and he likes to sit in it and read). He also sometimes moves it around to a random place to sit in and read. Definitely a much better investment than the silly soft seating, which I packed away in the basement about two years ago because it was never used and was just taking up space. My son has a sibling now, and I have no intention of even taking out the silly soft seating because it's just more clutter (though cute clutter, I must admit).",4,Ive purchased both the PKolino Little Reader Chair and the PKolino Silly Soft Seating and Im writing this review to hopefully help anyone who is debating between them Ill initially review each item and will then compare them The star rating above is specifically for the  PKolino Silly Soft SeatingPKolino Silly Soft SeatingPKolino Silly Soft Seating in Pipa  BlueI bought the PKolino Silly Soft Seating in orange for my 1 yr old son hoping hed use it as a chair but also hoping that hed enjoy building a tower with it using it as a table or whatever else he wanted to do He very rarely sits on it as a chair but has had a bit of fun pushing the top of it around the house and occasionally throwing some of the pieces He really enjoys sitting on the base sideways with one leg on each side as if riding a car and scooting around the house or being pushed on it across the floor The cover is fleecelike and picks up a lot of dirt easily from our hardwood floors and the foam is softer than I imagined but its a cute chair and we like it While my son did have fun playing with it on occasion I had hoped he would have shown more interest in it particularly in sitting on it This brings me to my 2nd purchasePKolino Little Reader ChairPKolino Little Reader Chair in GreenI bought the PKolino Little Reader Chair in orange for my 17 month old son who loves to read the same son who was 1 yr old when he got the Silly Soft Seating He likes to sit in it while reading his books and enjoys putting books in and taking them out of the side pockets When the product arrived I was surprised to see that the chair is meant for children 2yr since I hadnt noticed any mention of this on the Amazon description I was even more surprised at the size of the Little Reader Chair because it fits my son quite well and he is very petite 5th percentile Although its a small chair I think it will fit him for a couple of years but Id be surprised if these chairs were big enough for larger children The cover is fauxsuede and the chair is fairly sturdy for foamLittle Reader Chair vs Silly Soft SeatingI like both of these products but for different reasons If you want a chair for your child that they will sit and read in I would absolutely get the Little Reader Chair but if you arent looking specifically for a chair for your child and would like something more imaginative that they can be creative with Id get the Silly Soft Seating Its much more of a toy than a chair Also its not as sturdy as the little reader but is certainly sturdy enough Im glad we have both of these chairs because my son enjoys them but I think in the long run my son will get more use out of the Little Reader ChairUPDATE May 21 2013 UPDATEMy son is now almost 4 and he still occasionally uses the little reader chair we keep it next to a bookshelf and he likes to sit in it and read He also sometimes moves it around to a random place to sit in and read Definitely a much better investment than the silly soft seating which I packed away in the basement about two years ago because it was never used and was just taking up space My son has a sibling now and I have no intention of even taking out the silly soft seating because its just more clutter though cute clutter I must admit,1

31172,33.75140397934604,Stokke Scoot Stroller - Light Green,"We've been using the Stokke Scoot for about a year. It suits our needs perfectly. We live in an urban area and needed something that would be good for public transportation or driving in a car but also could do well in on the city streets. I agree that the wheels are on the smaller side and not as premium as Stokke's other two strollers &#8211;But the Scoot is half the price too! And with the Scoot you still get Stokke's warranty. It's three years and the BEST one on the market. Seriously no other brand compares to customer service and warranty inclusions. Stokke is PREMIUM. That was important to us when we were looking at strollers. The Scoot is not a full-size stroller so sure you don't get some of the bells and whistles (like there's not a solution for pushing two kids around, the tires are smaller, and the seat only less reclining positions.) But it DOES work with some car seats&#8211;you gotta get adapters, but still, you can have a travel system if you need one. It comes with a rain cover and mosquito net. I don't ever use the mosquito net but we use the rain cover all the time so that's nice to have (and bonus that it's included with purchase). The Scoot isn't a lightweight stroller either so don't expect something super lightweight. I appreciated that it seemed durable and I knew that the city streets would beat it up a little bit, so I didn't want something like an umbrella stroller. So the Scoot is in-between the full-size stroller category and umbrella category.I've NEVER felt that it's unsafe, ever. Smaller wheels on strollers (and I've had/used lots of different brands over the years) are more likely to get stuck in cracks of course, so this isn't really any breaking news here. I push the stroller using two hands. If I'm using it on uneven terrain or something I will lock the front wheels (activated by this little white lever thing by the front wheels) and that helps navigate too. I've never had the wheels just randomly 'lock up' like I read by another reviewer &#8211; I'm wondering if they accidentally are striking the brake or if they have a defect model because that's NOT what the stroller is supposed to do and not what mine does. If you're taller and have a long stride, the center-positioned brake might not be the right design for your needs. It's been fine for me. I don't often use the Scoot in the snow but it's been great for running errands around the city, so it does well on city streets and sidewalks, etc, and it's been fine in the rain too. And Stokke does have awesome customer service. I truly can't imagine them not taking something seriously. They're WHOLE brand model is about meeting and exceeding safety regulations and making products in the best interest of the child. That's the entire philosophy. So if someone has had a negative experience with the Scoot or think it might be defective, as a customer, I'd say just call Stokke's customer service number again and speak with another representative if you didn't feel they were listening to your needs previously. We shopped around for a long time and looked at other baby brands and Stokke's dedication to what's best for the child and safety has always stuck with me. (We also have the Sleepi crib system and I've always found their customer service to be top notch. We had the Sleepi system and paid for assembly and everything went seamlessly from ordering at the store and having it shipped & assembled in our apartment, no problems at all.) Stokke also seems to be growing A TON. I used to not see the brand around and my mom friends didn't know much about them, but now they're EVERYWHERE. A growing brand cares about customer service, and especially Stokke, they obviously care about safety, it's obviously in how they create their products and to me in terms of how I've been treated as a customer. So anyways, I love Stokke!Back to the Scoot&#8230;. I really love how the seat can face both ways and that there's a recline (Stokke calls it 'rest') and upright position. My son is always super comfortable in the seat. There's only two positions so like I said earlier it's not a full-size stroller, but you're not shelling out a grand either. The Scoot seat is more roomy so if you have a little baby or small child I'd recommend getting a head and neck support just to make the seat more snug. (My child is over 1 year old). The basket is a good size, so I can run a few errands. The Stokke changing bag hooks on the frame. The frame is super study. The fabric is high-quality and actually repels water (like a light drizzle) quite well. It's also a pretty big canopy, so there's good weather coverage for the child, either direction the baby is facing. If you want a sun parasol (sold separately) you can snap it into the Scoot seat and have more sun protection.Probably the BEST part about the Scoot is that it folds easily. Makes my life a ton easier, I'll tell you. Stokke has a video on their website that shows how fast and easily it folds. Check it out. It takes like 5 seconds to collapse it, I swear. So that's great. Like I said before, the Scoot is not super lightweight, but I appreciate that it's more durable than those umbrella stroller options. I can lift it just fine.We are really happy with our Scoot and will continue to use it, until our child reaches that max weight of 45 pounds. I did my research beforehand, so I knew that it fit the criteria I needed for a stroller, just something compact and easy to use and zip around the city and that I could throw in a car trunk if needed or carry onto the bus. It's a great option for someone who wants something more newborn-friendly than those little umbrella strollers and who can't afford or doesn't want something as big and super bulky as those full-size strollers that take multiple steps to collapse, etc, and can take up a ton of room in an apartment.Here's the Stokke website for information on the Scoot, this Amazon site doesn't have much details on

14456,33.24855403566575,"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I just tried this hands free breastpump bra, and I have to say, I love it! I previously tried the Medela easy expression bustier and I wasn't very happy with it.  Being an ample chested woman to start with, and then adding engorged breasts to the mix, I found the Medela bra to be too constricting and hard to position the pump flanges. I finally gave up and was just holding the pump each time. Then I found a lifesaver, well timesaver is more accurate, I was so excited to finally get my Simple Wishes bra!  With the Simple Wishes bra, both of my problems are resolved.  I love the adjustable back panel so you are sure to get the perfect fit every time.  I also think the zip in front panel is a genius addition!  Not everyone has breasts that are spaced the same and a little extra comfort room is nice so you are not smashing your breasts together to make the flange holes line up with your nipples.  Also, the four panel flange hole is a great invention!  It allows you to adjust the flange to get the perfect fit and placement each time you pump without having to make major adjustments.  It also provides a nice firm support for the pump so that you don't break suction when you move around.  I also want to mention the optional bra straps.  I love that I can put straps on the bra for additional support.  With out the straps, the bra fits great and it is very comfortable and functions perfectly.  I added the straps just to see how it was, and it improves upon an already awesome product.  The straps provide extra lift to the whole bra so you don't feel like you are sagging.  (back to the Medela bra for a moment, when I did get everything positioned just perfectly, I felt like my breasts were sagging and it made me feel more like a frumpy milk cow instead of a loving mother who wants to provide her son with all the benefits of breastmilk, even when I am away). Let's face it ladies, no one likes to feel like their breasts are sagging!My lucky husband got to be witness to the first time I used this Simple Wishes bra. He probably thinks I am crazy, the way I was ranting and raving about how awesome this bra is.  I really can't say it enough, I love this bra, and it makes pumping so much easier and much more enjoyable!",5,I just tried this hands free breastpump bra and I have to say I love it I previously tried the Medela easy expression bustier and I wasnt very happy with it  Being an ample chested woman to start with and then adding engorged breasts to the mix I found the Medela bra to be too constricting and hard to position the pump flanges I finally gave up and was just holding the pump each time Then I found a lifesaver well timesaver is more accurate I was so excited to finally get my Simple Wishes bra  With the Simple Wishes bra both of my problems are resolved  I love the adjustable back panel so you are sure to get the perfect fit every time  I also think the zip in front panel is a genius addition  Not everyone has breasts that are spaced the same and a little extra comfort room is nice so you are not smashing your breasts together to make the flange holes line up with your nipples  Also the four panel flange hole is a great invention  It allows you to adjust the flange to get the perfect fit and placement each time you pump without having to make major adjustments  It also provides a nice firm support for the pump so that you dont break suction when you move around  I also want to mention the optional bra straps  I love that I can put straps on the bra for additional support  With out the straps the bra fits great and it is very comfortable and functions perfectly  I added the straps just to see how it was and it improves upon an already awesome product  The straps provide extra lift to the whole bra so you dont feel like you are sagging  back to the Medela bra for a moment when I did get everything positioned just perfectly I felt like my breasts were sagging and it made me feel more like a frumpy milk cow instead of a loving mother who wants to provide her son with all the benefits of breastmilk even when I am away Lets face it ladies no one likes to feel like their breasts are saggingMy lucky husband got to be witness to the first time I used this Simple Wishes bra He probably thinks I am crazy the way I was ranting and raving about how awesome this bra is  I really cant say it enough I love this bra and it makes pumping so much easier and much more enjoyable,1
30024,33.014342525644814,"Ikea 36 Pcs Kalas Kids Plastic BPA Free Flatware, Bowl, Plate, Tumbler Set, Colorful","For the price this set is unbelievable- and trust me I've been through a lot of children's sets. We seem to inevitably lose dinnerware. This set comes with:6 bowls (2 cup capacity)6 cups (1 cup capacity)6 plates6 forks6 spoons6 dinner knivesThere are one of each in the following colors: blue, green, orange, bright yellow, bright pink, and purple.The plastic is microwave safe. I have not yet tried it with a dishwasher (we don't have one) so I can't determine how well it holds up in that. But we've made plenty of things in the microwave including reheating meals, oatmeal, and chicken nuggets.The cups are small and ideal size for kids ages 4 to 12. The flat bottom keeps them from spilling. The bowls are a bit small- but once again work good for kids ages 4 to 12. They also have flat bottoms which are great for preventing spills. They're also light-weight enough for kids to eat on the go with. We use them for bedtime snacks too. The plates are really neat because they have high sides. The sides go up about 1/2 and inch. Perfect for keeping things from spilling off the sides when kids are picking at their food! They are a bit small (desert plate sized) so they're more ideal for kids ages 3 to 8.The spoons, forks, and knives are actually quite big. I was expecting them to be child sized, but they're adequate for adult use too. The spoons hold enough soup for a nice bite. The forks are sharp enough to actually grab onto things. And the knives are great for letting kids learn to cut their own soft foods. They are a bit large so I'd say they're best for kids ages 6 to 12. But even I, as an adult, use them comfortable during meals.This whole set is pretty cute. The different mix and match colors let all three of my kids personalize their meals. The light-weight design is great for on the go and picnics. We can take them places and easily store them away. The plastic easily wipes clean too. Always a plus. The main things I'd like to point out is that the plates have high sides- GREAT for toddlers! But the other silverware is a bit large for little kids. Even so if you have an array of ages in your home- like I do; these are perfect!",5,For the price this set is unbelievable and trust me Ive been through a lot of childrens sets We seem to inevitably lose dinnerware This set comes with6 bowls 2 cup capacity6 cups 1 cup capacity6 plates6 forks6 spoons6 dinner knivesThere are one of each in the following colors blue green orange bright yellow bright pink and purpleThe plastic is microwave safe I have not yet tried it with a dishwasher we dont have one so I cant determine how well it holds up in that But weve made plenty of things in the microwave including reheating meals oatmeal and chicken nuggetsThe cups are small and ideal size for kids ages 4 to 12 The flat bottom keeps them from spilling The bowls are a bit small but once again work good for kids ages 4 to 12 They also have flat bottoms which are great for preventing spills Theyre also lightweight enough for kids to eat on the go with We use them for bedtime snacks too The plates are really neat because they have high sides The sides go up about 12 and inch Perfect for keeping things from spilling off the sides when kids are picking at their food They are a bit small desert plate sized so theyre more ideal for kids ages 3 to 8The spoons forks and knives are actually quite big I was expecting them to be child sized but theyre adequate for adult use too The spoons hold enough soup for a nice bite The forks are sharp enough to actually grab onto things And the knives are great for letting kids learn to cut their own soft foods They are a bit large so Id say theyre best for kids ages 6 to 12 But even I as an adult use them comfortable during mealsThis whole set is pretty cute The different mix and match colors let all three of my kids personalize their meals The lightweight design is great for on the go and picnics We can take them places and easily store them away The plastic easily wipes clean too Always a plus The main things Id like to point out is that the plates have high sides GREAT for toddlers But the other silverware is a bit large for little kids Even so if you have an array of ages in your home like I do these are perfect,1
