In fact, I've never written one of these reviews before, but I used them to research products when I was registering and I had to take the time to write one now and try to warn others.  I have been using the Avent bottles since my son was born 9 weeks ago and I have never been so dissatisfied with a product!  These bottles LEAK!  They are awful.  I just had a nightmare 3am feeding (actually all 3am feedings are nightmares, but this one was even worse than usual!).  The bottle leaked all over my son, me, my floor, my table.  I had to interrupt my son's feeding several times to wash him off and try to stop the flow of milk onto my floor- I even had to change his bib 3 times because it had soaked through.  These leaks seem to happen all the time- I have actually thrown out one or two bottles, hoping that there was a strange, abnormal ""defect"" with one of the bottles or the nipple, etc, but NO- these bottles are just leaking!

14202,-18.94816287034977,"Tike Tech Single City X4 Swivel Stroller, Pacific Blue","I initially thought this was a very sturdy, long-lasting stroller.  I had to have it replaced (through the retailer, who apparently ate the cost) once because of a defective wheel.  It wasn't long before I realized the basket on the new stroller was defective, unusable.  I have tried for months to get it replaced through the company, which is located in Canada. When they finally responded to emails, they expected me to pay to have it shipped to Canada, wait for several weeks until they could find someone to repair it and ship it back as they ""don't keep them in stock"".  I explained to them I was trying to just have the basket replaced rather than the whole stroller in an effort to not waste resources.  They apparently don't care about that.  I then explained it is not the responsibity of the customer to have to pay to have a defective part replaced and told them I will be having the whole stroller replaced - again.  They promised to replace the basket.  That was almost a month ago.  I emailed again, as usual they don't respond.  I contacted the retailer a few times, they tried several times to get through to the company but got no answer (?!).  They confessed they are bewildered by the lack of customer service, even to retailers and cited comparisons to other stroller companies that ""are right there"".  The problem with Tike Tech company is they are capable of creating a good stroller, but they don't seem to have any quality control so defective products go out the door.  Since they don't have a working customer support, and no incentive to keep customers, there is no way to remedy these defects.  According to the retailer, they are out of touch with the customer.  I make this clear as it inevitably means this company is heading towards closure and you'll be stuck with a potentially unsafe stroller.",2.0,I initially thought this was a very sturdy longlasting stroller  I had to have it replaced through the retailer who apparently ate the cost once because of a defective wheel  It wasnt long before I realized the basket on the new stroller was defective unusable  I have tried for months to get it replaced through the company which is located in Canada When they finally responded to emails they expected me to pay to have it shipped to Canada wait for several weeks until they could find someone to repair it and ship it back as they dont keep them in stock  I explained to them I was trying to just have the basket replaced rather than the whole stroller in an effort to not waste resources  They apparently dont care about that  I then explained it is not the responsibity of the customer to have to pay to have a defective part replaced and told them I will be having the whole stroller replaced  again  They promised to replace the basket  That was almost a month ago  I emailed again as usual they dont respond  I contacted the retailer a few times they tried several times to get through to the company but got no answer   They confessed they are bewildered by the lack of customer service even to retailers and cited comparisons to other stroller companies that are right there  The problem with Tike Tech company is they are capable of creating a good stroller but they dont seem to have any quality control so defective products go out the door  Since they dont have a working customer support and no incentive to keep customers there is no way to remedy these defects  According to the retailer they are out of touch with the customer  I make this clear as it inevitably means this company is heading towards closure and youll be stuck with a potentially unsafe stroller,-1.0
10390,-19.62838434264046,Baby Jogger Car Seat Adapter for City Mini / City Elite,"We have new twins, and made the investment in this City Select system.  The stroller seems very nice but the car seat adapters are a total disappointment.  They are poorly designed; our Grace Snugrides are a poor fit into the attachments.  We have installed them correctly - an email with photos and 20 minute conversation with product support manager confirm this.Design Flaws:- they place the car seats farther forward than they should (could) making the whole unit longer than it needs to be and pushing the front car seat out of the front farther than it needs to be.- attachment is very poor - the U-shaped brackets are completely the wrong shape you'd want to fit with a Snugride - I know this is a universal adaptor but our Snap N Go (see more below) does this substantially better for much cheaper.- instructions do not provide any information about how to adjust the adaptor so that the proper fitting occurs between the black U shaped plastic support and the plastic fins on the Snugride.  This required a call to BJ to confirm and I was told ""we're in the process of revising those instructions to be better for the future.""- Even with conversations with Baby Jogger and photos, we can't get one of them to fully engage the spring loaded hook on the Snugride bottom with the metal bar of the adaptor - probably not a safety hazard because there are redundancies in the supports but BJ should be able to do much better for this price!- the Snugride mounts in such a fashion that the lips/hooks/loops (whatever you call them - they are intended to secure the woven strap that goes over the top of the car seat) arent used and the adaptor strap goes awkwardly over a bulb of plastic on the side of the car seat - just shoddy design that should be better!As I said above, we bought a used Snap N Go double to get us through the 2 months that Baby Jogger couldn't ship these adaptors because of some sort of production issue.  For $29 it isn't perfect, and the City Select is a better stroller, but the attachment of the car seats is far superior on the Snap N Go and it is also a ""universal"" car seat fitting.We're very disappointed to have spent $130 on the two adaptors, making about $800 for the whole City Select system, and we couldn't even use it for 2 months due to BJ issues with production and shipment (total of 3 months from time we originally paid for it).  So we'll get a few more months use out of them but may still use our Snap N Go because of the more secure fitting ofthe car seats, lighter weight, and easier use.This is my first experience with Baby Jogger, and they say this adaptor style is the same used on all their stroller for 3 years.

28222,-20.19312544487773,"Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black","PROS:Looks good. Sleek blackHigh weight limitsSafe. Haven't personally tested this, but it does seems quite sturdy and protectiveEasily clicks into baseCONS:Freaking heavy! Just the seat alone weighs just under 10 lbs. Add in just a baby or an infant closer to the weight limit, either way this thing weighs a tons! I picked this seat for the high weight limits because I have heavy babies, but I do not know how I could carry my kid around in this seat. Way too heavy.The handle is VERY uncomfortable! There is no easy way to hold this seat. The handle is not very ergonomical. It's awkward to hold in just about every way. Also, if the sun shade is up you can barely fit you hand onto the handle, and there is no way you can slip your arm through to carry it up like that. I don't have big or thick hands at all, so it is really just the design. Also, any way you try to carry the seat the built-in stroller latches will get in the way. They either whack into your legs as you walk or smash into your hip if you try to carry it pressed onto your hip...does that make sense? It's very annoying. I have not figured out an easy way to carry this with a child in it, unless it is on the stroller, but really...who is going to put their kid and car seat on a stroller just to get in and out of the car? I really don't like carrying this car seat.In addition to being heavy, this seat is huge. It's nice that it should fit a larger kid, but it doesn't not fit in most cars well at all. I have a Ford Escape and have to have the passenger seat all the way up to fit this seat in correctly. Now, it does fit in my friend's Lexus SUV quite well, but most cars I think it would be a hassle, especially if they are more compact.Does not fit in any shopping cart well. The only way to carry this seat in a shopping cart is to put the whole thing in the big part of the cart. It will not fit on the child seat (I know that is not safe for most car seats anyways....). This seat will take up the entire cart! The only place to put your groceries etc is either in the basket or on the child in the seat. So very annoying. If by chance your baby falls asleep on the way to the store you either have to tough it out and lose all your shopping cart space or wake baby up and put him in a carrier.The seat is very deep and the buckles get lost in it. Put your baby in the seat and you have to fish under and around the baby to get all the buckles out to buckle the baby. We also have the Britax Marathon (which we like a lot) and that seat has velcro on the buckle straps so you can velcro them out of the way while you put the child in the seat. This seat doesn't have that and it is very inconvenient. Try putting a sleeping baby in the seat and not wake him up..... It's very tricky.Sometimes the straps tighten unevenly. You'll have to fish around back (which is very complicated if the baby is in the car) and line up the strap thing in the back to get the straps even.The seat cover does not come off easily to wash. The Marathon slips on and off very conveniently.Might just be my kid, but I've seen this on other reviews. Baby gets really hot sitting in this seat. Frequently after just a short trip I will take him out and his back will be all sweaty.I wish I could return this seat, but unfortunately I bought it a couple months before my son was born and didn't know how much I would hate it. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SEAT AT ALL.If you still want one, let me know!

I received it as a shower gift from my registry and once home I wanted to try it out.  When I expanded the tub, the center never snapped into place, so I could imagine that it would leak water out of it and perhaps could even pinch the baby's skin.  I tried everything to get it to snap but had no luck.  Then when I tried to collapse it I had such difficulty that by the time I was finished both of my hands were bright red from pushing and pulling and pressing the tabs.  The tabs on the sides were impossible to push down.  I thought this was a very poorly designed product and took it back immediately and purchased just a regular tub with an infant attachment.

It is very clear that many users did NOT read the directions.There are three ways to use this monitor.1. With video and sound on at all times (Yes, It will drain the battery quickly).2. With video turning off after 3 minutes of no sound above 60 dB (Therefore, conserving battery by not continually showing the video).  *It will turn back on if it senses loud sounds (baby crying, yelling).3. With video AND sound off - only turning on when there are loud sounds heard. (This is what other monitors call &#34;sleep mode&#34;...so that the parents aren't hearing the baby moving around in the crib...only the sounds that need to be heard at night).If you're having problems with no sound, or not video, or it cutting in and out.

It continued to happen.  I know a lot of users complained that this messed up their wifi...well I don't know if mine did or not. I even followed the directions in the manual to fix the problem. I can tell you that it continued to happen despite my router being turned off.  And it didn't matter how close or far away I was from the camera with the parent unit, so it wasn't a reception problem either.2.  The video quality wasn't as good as I expected.  There was a lot of &#34;noise&#34;....you photographer people will understand.3.  Even on the highest volume setting - it was hard to hear my daughter.  The high setting on this monitor compared to low-medium volume setting of my old monitor.4.  The manual states to point the antennae down if you have this monitor on a higher floor.  That way it's always pointed down toward the below floors where you most likely will be with the parent unit.  Well now you can't turn the camera on and off.  The antennae blocks it.5.  It's light weight and cheap feeling.  I have a feeling that if my toddler accidentally got a hold of it once...it'd be toast.

2511,-21.666462157245387,"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle","I registered for this item & it was ordered for me by my mother-in-law.  When I received the shipment, the circular framing of the bassinet was broken. I contacted BRU/Amazon and they picked it up/sent a new one.  When I got the second one, it was broken in a different place.  I was more than a little irritated by this point, so I called them to complain/make arrangements for a 3rd shipment, because although irritated, this was still the bassinet I wanted because of the visual appeal.  I was told I would get a 3rd shipment, but a few days later my mother-in-law was notified that they would NOT be sending a 3rd, and that she would be refunded due a more widespread problem with this particular item than they anticipated.  I was extremely upset because the item was still available to purchase online (was not available to purchase in BRU stores, if so I wouldn't  have even tried to have it shipped again) to anyone else,and how dare them decide for me that I wouldn't be getting another one.The bottom line was the shipping charges to Amazon/BRU, it costs them more & more each time they ship a new one/pick up an old one.  They finally agreed to send a 3rd as ""an exception"" and yes when I received that one it was ALSO BROKEN.  Now this not only makes me wonder about the sturdiness of the craftsmanship, but also WHY DOESN'T THE MANUFACTURER PACK THIS ITEM BETTER????  I did confirm it is packed/shippped directly from Badger Basket Company, not Amazon, but there was ""nothing that could be done"" to change the packing method, not even labeling the box ""fragile"" or ""handle with care"".  I have read a few other customer reviews that mention the same problem with the poor packing of this item.  There is no foam padding, no bubble wrap, no cardboard inserts, NOTHING to protect the item.  I have received dvd shipments packed more carefully than this!At this point I wanted nothing to do with this awful product, nor would I ever purchase something by Badger Basket Company again, (also the sheets only come in white and are paper thin, I don't think I would put my baby on them).I gladly accepted the refund for this bassinet and purchased a different one that is MUCH more functional, rated better by doctors/baby experts, and is able to roll around & move right up to my bed.  The ""Elegance Round Bassinet"" has no wheels, is stationary and quite a bit heavier, and let's face it, a bassinet is something I plan to use for a little while then probably store in the attic (the one I ended up purchsing folds up very compactly and fits in it's own storage bag, takes up a lot less room than the round), so my second choice actually ended up being muuuuuuch better.One more thing, the quality isn't quite as nice as it looks online, but how would anyone know since that is the only way to acquire it??)Save yourself some time and a headache, do not get this no matter how cute you think it looks.If I could give 0 stars I would.",1.0,I registered for this item  it was ordered for me by my motherinlaw  When I received the shipment the circular framing of the bassinet was broken I contacted BRUAmazon and they picked it upsent a new one  When I got the second one it was broken in a different place  I was more than a little irritated by this point so I called them to complainmake arrangements for a 3rd shipment because although irritated this was still the bassinet I wanted because of the visual appeal  I was told I would get a 3rd shipment but a few days later my motherinlaw was notified that they would NOT be sending a 3rd and that she would be refunded due a more widespread problem with this particular item than they anticipated  I was extremely upset because the item was still available to purchase online was not available to purchase in BRU stores if so I wouldnt  have even tried to have it shipped again to anyone elseand how dare them decide for me that I wouldnt be getting another oneThe bottom line was the shipping charges to AmazonBRU it costs them more  more each time they ship a new onepick up an old one  They finally agreed to send a 3rd as an exception and yes when I received that one it was ALSO BROKEN  Now this not only makes me wonder about the sturdiness of the craftsmanship but also WHY DOESNT THE MANUFACTURER PACK THIS ITEM BETTER  I did confirm it is packedshippped directly from Badger Basket Company not Amazon but there was nothing that could be done to change the packing method not even labeling the box fragile or handle with care  I have read a few other customer reviews that mention the same problem with the poor packing of this item  There is no foam padding no bubble wrap no cardboard inserts NOTHING to protect the item  I have received dvd shipments packed more carefully than thisAt this point I wanted nothing to do with this awful product nor would I ever purchase something by Badger Basket Company again also the sheets only come in white and are paper thin I dont think I would put my baby on themI gladly accepted the refund for this bassinet and purchased a different one that is MUCH more functional rated better by doctorsbaby experts and is able to roll around  move right up to my bed  The Elegance Round Bassinet has no wheels is stationary and quite a bit heavier and lets face it a bassinet is something I plan to use for a little while then probably store in the attic the one I ended up purchsing folds up very compactly and fits in its own storage bag takes up a lot less room than the round so my second choice actually ended up being muuuuuuch betterOne more thing the quality isnt quite as nice as it looks online but how would anyone know since that is the only way to acquire itSave yourself some time and a headache do not get this no matter how cute you think it looksIf I could give 0 stars I would,-1.0
3732,-21.76103399087882,Cabinet Flex-Lock (2 pack) from Safety First,"I am a mother of 4 children, ages 6-18 months.  I have tried almost every lock, and this by FAR is the best lock out there.  Yes, the lock is a challenge to open, but that is the point... and the best part is it's durability.  I have six of these Safety First Flex Locks for almost 7 years and NOT ONE has broken.  We moved a year ago to a house with many more cabinets in the kitchens and bathrooms, hence my search for a new lock began.  I would have purchased these in the store but I cannot find them (they are not sold in Babies r us, Target, or Walmart.) I have had a terrible time finding them...if you can believe it, the manufacturers label is not on any of the ones I have, so I could not identify who made them!  I have scoured the internet for an hour, hunting them down!  So glad to see I can still buy them on-line.The best way I can describe this lock is by comparing it to 'rabbit ears'. There are 2 zip ties that loop around the knobs and come back down inside the lock.  I am guessing the other reviewers were trying to push all 3 buttons at once to open the lock.  That would be terribly difficult, but you only need to push 2 buttons to get the lock to loosen on one side (one 'ear'.) The lock would remain hanging off the other knob by the other ear, but that is ok with me - I am getting in to the cabinet temporarily so I am going to re-lock it anyway.I only loosen the left side of the lock to open the cabinets.  To do so, I hold the lock in both hands.  I push the left bottom button with my left thumb, while simultaneously pushing the middle button with my right thumb. Then - pull on the lock (while still holding the buttons down, which is easy as I am already clutching the thing with my thumbs against my palms) and it loosens off the left knob.  If you want to remove the lock off the other knob, then you would just repeat the process on the other side.  To lock it back I simply close the doors, then slide the bunny ear back over the knob and pull on the end of the zip tie until it is tight on the knob again.I recently bought the newer Safety 1st Push and Snap lock that have a similar 'rabbit ear' style zip tie but the lock is different; I guarantee they will be recalled in short order. All 8 I bought are broken - within a month of their purchase. There are many design flaws... on a couple of them the back falls off, so the little plastic zip tie falls right off the knob... then they cannot be snapped back together.  Also the little buttons come off (a MAJOR choking hazard); both the 'lock' button on the left clip as well as the button on the right side.  If the button on the left clip comes off the whole lock needs to be thrown out, but if the button on the right clip breaks the lock will still work but it can be opened very easily, so you will end up throwing it out as well.  Hopefully you will find the plastic buttons before the baby does! I tried 3 other kinds of slide locks made by different manufacturers with a similar design... they have one bracket that a long horseshoe shaped sliding clip slides into, but they will not hold doors closed that have knobs.  They are great for double doors that have handles (shaped like coffee cup handles) but if you have little pull knobs then a sliding lock will not work for you. With very little effort your child will slide the lock right off the knobs.Keeping the doors locked is difficult; no matter what you buy it should require you to use both hands to open.  If you want to keep the kids safe, or keep them out of the TV cabinet, china, medical, chemical, toilet items, arts and crafts, etc...get these. They are the best and they will last forever!",5.0,I am a mother of 4 children ages 618 months  I have tried almost every lock and this by FAR is the best lock out there  Yes the lock is a challenge to open but that is the point and the best part is its durability  I have six of these Safety First Flex Locks for almost 7 years and NOT ONE has broken  We moved a year ago to a house with many more cabinets in the kitchens and bathrooms hence my search for a new lock began  I would have purchased these in the store but I cannot find them they are not sold in Babies r us Target or Walmart I have had a terrible time finding themif you can believe it the manufacturers label is not on any of the ones I have so I could not identify who made them  I have scoured the internet for an hour hunting them down  So glad to see I can still buy them onlineThe best way I can describe this lock is by comparing it to rabbit ears There are 2 zip ties that loop around the knobs and come back down inside the lock  I am guessing the other reviewers were trying to push all 3 buttons at once to open the lock  That would be terribly difficult but you only need to push 2 buttons to get the lock to loosen on one side one ear The lock would remain hanging off the other knob by the other ear but that is ok with me  I am getting in to the cabinet temporarily so I am going to relock it anywayI only loosen the left side of the lock to open the cabinets  To do so I hold the lock in both hands  I push the left bottom button with my left thumb while simultaneously pushing the middle button with my right thumb Then  pull on the lock while still holding the buttons down which is easy as I am already clutching the thing with my thumbs against my palms and it loosens off the left knob  If you want to remove the lock off the other knob then you would just repeat the process on the other side  To lock it back I simply close the doors then slide the bunny ear back over the knob and pull on the end of the zip tie until it is tight on the knob againI recently bought the newer Safety 1st Push and Snap lock that have a similar rabbit ear style zip tie but the lock is different I guarantee they will be recalled in short order All 8 I bought are broken  within a month of their purchase There are many design flaws on a couple of them the back falls off so the little plastic zip tie falls right off the knob then they cannot be snapped back together  Also the little buttons come off a MAJOR choking hazard both the lock button on the left clip as well as the button on the right side  If the button on the left clip comes off the whole lock needs to be thrown out but if the button on the right clip breaks the lock will still work but it can be opened very easily so you will end up throwing it out as well  Hopefully you will find the plastic buttons before the baby does I tried 3 other kinds of slide locks made by different manufacturers with a similar design they have one bracket that a long horseshoe shaped sliding clip slides into but they will not hold doors closed that have knobs  They are great for double doors that have handles shaped like coffee cup handles but if you have little pull knobs then a sliding lock will not work for you With very little effort your child will slide the lock right off the knobsKeeping the doors locked is difficult no matter what you buy it should require you to use both hands to open  If you want to keep the kids safe or keep them out of the TV cabinet china medical chemical toilet items arts and crafts etcget these They are the best and they will last forever,1.0
19776,-21.843305253491604,"Mountain Buggy Terrain Stroller, Flint","I live in NZ and purchased this stroller at the start of Sept 2011. I had heard poor reviews about the Mt Buggy service team in general, however being a kiwi, i was keen to support a kiwi owned business.  I was specifically looking for a jogging stroller and hence chose the terrain (as it is marketed as a jogging stroller hybrid).In general, whilst this stroller ""looks cool"" it is heavy and bulky and doesn't fold down very compactly. Only just fits the back of my audi allroad wagon. It is the worst jogging stroller and it will not track straight when the front wheel is locked out front, even in spite of the acclaimed ""tracking device"" on it. I had 3 issues in the 3 weeks I owned the buggy.  It arrived with one rear Tyre being flat upon unpacking the stroller. Then when i tried to go for a run with the wheel locked forwards, it wouldn't track in a remotely straight line, unless i jogged with it on its 2 back wheels (very dangerous) and then the brakes started screeching when jogging down hill (it was so loud that i was worried about damage to my baby's ears). I returned it to Mt Buggy who didn't call me or anything, but sent it back to the store I bought it from saying there was nothing wrong with it and its not meant to track in a straight line anyway- go figure! Thankfully i was offered a full refund or to keep it (they wouldn't replace it as they said it was fine). I thought Mt Buggy where somewhat arrogant about their lack of acknowledging this tracking problem is a major design floor and also not having taken responsibility over the screeching brake issue - saying that it didn't make that noise when they looked at it.  Anyway, i took the refund and bought a baby jogger summit off amazon and have had NO PROBLEMS at all with it. Its a real pleasure to use compared to the terrain and I would HIGHLY recommend the baby jogger over the Mt Buggy - shame on you NZ!!! I wish i could promote a NZ product but unfortunately based on my experience, I would say go for the baby jogger!",1.0,I live in NZ and purchased this stroller at the start of Sept 2011 I had heard poor reviews about the Mt Buggy service team in general however being a kiwi i was keen to support a kiwi owned business  I was specifically looking for a jogging stroller and hence chose the terrain as it is marketed as a jogging stroller hybridIn general whilst this stroller looks cool it is heavy and bulky and doesnt fold down very compactly Only just fits the back of my audi allroad wagon It is the worst jogging stroller and it will not track straight when the front wheel is locked out front even in spite of the acclaimed tracking device on it I had 3 issues in the 3 weeks I owned the buggy  It arrived with one rear Tyre being flat upon unpacking the stroller Then when i tried to go for a run with the wheel locked forwards it wouldnt track in a remotely straight line unless i jogged with it on its 2 back wheels very dangerous and then the brakes started screeching when jogging down hill it was so loud that i was worried about damage to my babys ears I returned it to Mt Buggy who didnt call me or anything but sent it back to the store I bought it from saying there was nothing wrong with it and its not meant to track in a straight line anyway go figure Thankfully i was offered a full refund or to keep it they wouldnt replace it as they said it was fine I thought Mt Buggy where somewhat arrogant about their lack of acknowledging this tracking problem is a major design floor and also not having taken responsibility over the screeching brake issue  saying that it didnt make that noise when they looked at it  Anyway i took the refund and bought a baby jogger summit off amazon and have had NO PROBLEMS at all with it Its a real pleasure to use compared to the terrain and I would HIGHLY recommend the baby jogger over the Mt Buggy  shame on you NZ I wish i could promote a NZ product but unfortunately based on my experience I would say go for the baby jogger,-1.0
408,-23.00843036505197,Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"(This is a long review, but if you read the whole thing it may save you some money and frustration. If you just want to read the bit about the Bottles, jump down to the 6th Paragraph and read from there)I used Avent products with my first child (5 years ago!) and was absolutely thrilled. Back then, I was a solo-mother on welfare, so the cost was a real struggle for me, but I was so thrilled with the product that I found the money to buy the things I needed for my child.Five years on, and oh how things have changed. This time around I am married and have the funds to be able to buy whichever brand I want, without money being a consideration. So, I eagerly stocked up on all things Avent. I bought the 4 oz bottles, 9 oz bottles, disposable bottle kit, Isis Electric Breast Pump, pacifiers, Bottle & Food Warmer, Bottle Tote, Formula Dispeser, Microwave Steam Steriliser ... the whole shebang!The first thing to go wrong was the Isis Breast Pump ($US150 from Babies'R'Us). It would work fine for anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes, and then the suction would slack off and the rhythm would go out of whack, stopping the flow of milk from my breast. I would then have to turn off the machine and pump manually instead, or be left only partially expressed. I was reliant on the pump to take off my milk, as my baby would not latch, and I really wanted to keep giving her breast milk. When the machine broke down I contacted Avent and asked for a refund, as I was going to have to replace the machine. Avent told me that it was a non-refundable item, but if I waited a week they would send out a label for me to ship the pump back to them and then IF THEY FOUND A FAULT they would then repair it and return it to me. They said it would take 2-4 weeks. And what was I to do without a breast pump for a month, I asked??! The lady on the phone suggested that I purchase their manual pump to use in the meantime, and boasted that it would only cost me about $US50. Needless-to-say, I lost a lot of money on this, and was absolutely furious!! I threw the worthless pump in the trash and ended up 100% formula-feeding my baby.Then there were issues with some of the nipples tearing, and they were less than a month old. I figured this was just my misfortune, so rather than make a fuss about it, I simply replaced the nipples at my own expense.Next came the distorted bottles. I noticed one day that the plastic of one of the 4 oz bottles was warped. I thought it a little odd, but again thought that I had probably just caught a wonky batch and didn't think too much about it. Then another bottle warped, and another, and another, and another ... fairly soon I had 5 warped bottles (some 4 oz, some 9 oz). Enough was enough! I called Avent again and complained, only to have the woman on the phone tell me that I mustn't have read the instrustions on the MICROWAVE STEAM STERILISER properly. The woman asked me to confirm the wattage of my microwave, the amount of time I was putting the bottles in for, and how much water I was using (900W, 5 minutes, 200 mls). After telling her, she confirmed that yes, that was all correct, but she still said that I must have been doing something wrong during the sterilising process.The lady sent me out a label to send the bottles back to them for 'testing'. She said that once the bottles had been tested then they would get back to me. Well, while waiting for the label to arrive, I ensured that I absolutely was following the instructions correctly when I used the Steriliser, but I still managed to have two more bottles warp on me, giving me a total of 7 warped bottles to return!!I finally got the label and sent the bottles back. About a week later Avent called and said that the tests showed I had ""overloaded"" the Steriliser, and that had caused the bottles to warp. She said that ""as a one-off courtesy"" they would replace the five 9oz bottles. I pointed out to her that I had stacked the Steriliser as told to do so in the illustrations of the instruction booklet, and when I asked about the two 4 oz bottles I had also returned, she denied that they had received them (even though I put them all in the package myself!!) and refused to discuss the matter any further. So, I have lost 2 bottles, and have a steriliser that apparently likes to melt bottles regardless of how cautious I am about follwing the directions.The other things I have had issues with are the pacifiers and the Bottle Tote. The pacifiers had a hard edge on the silicone, which was very uncomfortable for my newborn. I ended up replacing these with a different brand, as Avent wanted me to return the pacifiers to them at my own expense before they would consider replacing them. The Bottle Tote packaging states that it will keep bottles warm or cold for ""up to 4 hours"". This is more like ""up to 2 hours"", but even that is dubious. In order to get the bottles hot enough to stay warm for 4 hours, it would have to be boiling water, but if you put boiling water into the bottles, the pressure becomes too much for them to handle, so that's not an option. I have ended up throwing out the Bottle Tote (which cost me $15) and purchasing a mid-size Thermos. (I put the water of about the right temperature into the Thermos and take empty bottles with me. I even use the Thermos at home, so that I do not have to wait for the Avent Bottle Warmer to hurry up and do it's thing at 3am!)I also have the Via Nurser Kit and addtional containers, but have found that the lids sometimes do not seal properly, and therefore leak. Very annoying, especially when you had pre-mixed formula in the container, your baby is hungry, and you're an hour drive from home!I am absolutely disappointed with Avent. Almost every product of theirs that I have purchased this time around has been defective in one way or another, and their cutomer service level has been absolutely pathetic. They have obviously never heard ""the customer is always right"" because the have continually placed the blame solely on me for the issues that I have had.Avent used to be a great company with a great product, and now it seems that they are simply relying on their good reputation of the past to carry them through the future. It's not good enough. Their products are NOT worth the money anymore, and I strongly recommend that no one buy any of their products. There are tons of very good (better!) products available on the market, and I will be replacing all of my Avent equipment with another brand as soon as I can. (I noticed while at Target the other day that Circo are now making 'wide neck bottles' that look exactly like the Avent ones, but at almost half the price ... I think I'll give them a go!

However, I was incredibly disappointed with the quality of the bag.  After using it for just 2 weeks, the stiching along the main zipper on the bag was starting to show strain.

Within a couple days it completely detached and left a hole along the sipper, their was additional strain marks along the entire zipper.  I figured it was just a one time bag defect, so I exchanged it for a new one.  Unfortunately after 3 weeks my 2nd bag was showing the same wear and tore along the same zipper in two places.

It was an accidental drop by the busy mother, and the LCD screen cracked.  So I called Motorola support.  I explained what happened.  The rep informed me that the damage wasn't covered under warranty.  I said I knew that would be the case and asked how to purchase a replacement handheld unit or repair the screen.She informed me that they could not do this.  Motorola doesn't sell replacement handheld units, they only swap units covered by warranty.  They do however sell replacement cameras.  Of course, the cameras don't move around much and don't get dropped accidentally like the handheld units do.The monitor set is about $250 (camera and handheld).  A camera by itself is about $100.

The only option is to buy another complete set.Needless to say, I will be buying a new monitor, but it won't be a Motorola.  The unit worked fine until it broke - I'll give them that much credit.  However, having no replacement or repair option for the handheld unit really sucks.  I don't know about other parents out there, but with a toddler and a newborn, we are constantly running around with our hair on fire and dropping things.  I have no problem paying to repair or replace an item I break due to negligence.  But not giving me the option to repair or replace the broken item and telling me the only option is to buy a whole new set really irks me.  The rep actually told me to look for it on eBay (gee, thanks).Don't buy this item unless you are 100% sure you will never drop the handheld unit.

8628,-24.14804722841329,"Room Magic Desk/Chair Set, Tropical Seas Natural","It's such a shame, this desk. It is marketed as a ""quality product...made with sustainable hard wood with a natural finish and stained...and varnished..."". It is hard wood and it is a natural finish stained and varnished, but the problem is the quality. I decided the other reviewers with problems were just unlucky. After receiving this item twice, I think you'd be lucky to get a good one.The first desk had shipping issues. UPS obviously overlooked the fragile and this end up notices. There was a large hole in the top of the box that had been patched. I later figured out not only had it been patched, but the box top and been removed, the top layer of styrofoam had been swapped end to end and replaced, and quite possibly whoever did this left their box cutter in the box, because there was one loose in it when I opened it. The major damage from shipping was that the corner of the top was hit and basically smashed.On top of that, one drawer front was detached completely. One cleat between the desk top and side was broken in half with one half attached and one half loose. One bag of hardware was missing. Another drawer front was split but still attached. Getting the picture? The shipping was poor, but that doesn't explain it all. So, I sent that one back and asked for a replacement.The second one arrived in better shape. Naturally, UPS left it standing on an end leaning against my window. But, there were far fewer holes in the box. I was optimistic. Here's what was wrong with this one. Same drawer front(in the row) was detached from the drawer. Drawer back of same drawer was also detached. Desk top corner damaged (same exact corner because there is only cardboard protecting it and just about zero chance the shipper isn't going to stand it on an end at some point). A chair rail was broken all the way through. The desk back, the piece that stands as a backstop at the rear of the desk top, was split on the bottom where the dowel hole was. That dowel was broken in half. Also, the finial/decorative pieces were just plain missing. The cardboard container the first box had them in was there, but the pieces weren't in it.On the plus side, no outgassing. Which makes it all the more shameful that they couldn't get it right. The desk I'm typing this at is very similar to the ""Magic"" one in that it's a put it together yourself thing that weighs a lot and is shipped in a box.

25931,-24.218725574431048,"Graco ComfortSport Convertible Car Seat, Zara","This is a dreadful car seat. I would *never* recommend it. I unfortunately had no choice but to use it and could not return it due to the situation I found myself in, but I digress. I hate this car seat with the passion of a thousand burning suns and here is why:1. A bitch to install. It will *not* install correctly into a Toyota Tundra, particularly rear facing. No matter how tight I made the belts in my truck, the seat would still wobble. Stuffed 3 or 4 towels under the seat to make sure it was reclined at the right level, it still wobbled. Snaked the belt through the tunnel on the bottom trying to secure it? Cut my hand in the sharp plastic bits.... it still wobbled back and forth and front to back!  Trying to install it in a Camry wasn't much better. So if you have a Toyota be forewarned, this seat doesn't work well in them.2. Impossible to adjust the seat belts unless you take it apart. You cannot loosen the belts if needs be, you have to take the whole thing out in order to loosen them. Tightening them is easier, you just pull the strap in the front of the seat. However, that's hard to do rear facing. This seat seems much more designed for forward facing than rear facing. Everything about it makes having it rear facing hard.3. Very uncomfortable for baby.A. It's hard plastic with little padding. There is no cushy-ness at all. Just cheap fabric covering hard plastic.B. The head rests are awful and do not support the head or neck at all. The slope of the bucket seat puts baby in an awkward position that is harmful to their back. And it IS a bucket seat, really. It is very hard to get a baby in and out of.C. The seat belts are prone to twist and of course flop down when you are trying to put your kiddo into the seat. They are cheaply made and after a few months have started to fray.D. The chest latch is cheaply made. Mine broke. Prior to busting it would stick on the top making it hard to latch and unlatch.E. The fabric is cheap as all hell, it is not breathable, meaning if you are in a hot climate your baby will get very sweaty. It stains and tears easily.4. I don't recommend this seat at all, particularly a newborn. The seat is way too large for them and their heads will flop all around even with the crappy head rests. It will not [safely] tilt back far enough for an newborn and their heads will rest on their chest which makes breathing hard.5. It's made in China. It's a piece of trash. Buy an American made or European made car seat. Your child's safety and comfort is worth spending a bit more on.",1.0,This is a dreadful car seat I would never recommend it I unfortunately had no choice but to use it and could not return it due to the situation I found myself in but I digress I hate this car seat with the passion of a thousand burning suns and here is why1 A bitch to install It will not install correctly into a Toyota Tundra particularly rear facing No matter how tight I made the belts in my truck the seat would still wobble Stuffed 3 or 4 towels under the seat to make sure it was reclined at the right level it still wobbled Snaked the belt through the tunnel on the bottom trying to secure it Cut my hand in the sharp plastic bits it still wobbled back and forth and front to back  Trying to install it in a Camry wasnt much better So if you have a Toyota be forewarned this seat doesnt work well in them2 Impossible to adjust the seat belts unless you take it apart You cannot loosen the belts if needs be you have to take the whole thing out in order to loosen them Tightening them is easier you just pull the strap in the front of the seat However thats hard to do rear facing This seat seems much more designed for forward facing than rear facing Everything about it makes having it rear facing hard3 Very uncomfortable for babyA Its hard plastic with little padding There is no cushyness at all Just cheap fabric covering hard plasticB The head rests are awful and do not support the head or neck at all The slope of the bucket seat puts baby in an awkward position that is harmful to their back And it IS a bucket seat really It is very hard to get a baby in and out ofC The seat belts are prone to twist and of course flop down when you are trying to put your kiddo into the seat They are cheaply made and after a few months have started to frayD The chest latch is cheaply made Mine broke Prior to busting it would stick on the top making it hard to latch and unlatchE The fabric is cheap as all hell it is not breathable meaning if you are in a hot climate your baby will get very sweaty It stains and tears easily4 I dont recommend this seat at all particularly a newborn The seat is way too large for them and their heads will flop all around even with the crappy head rests It will not safely tilt back far enough for an newborn and their heads will rest on their chest which makes breathing hard5 Its made in China Its a piece of trash Buy an American made or European made car seat Your childs safety and comfort is worth spending a bit more on,-1.0
23825,-25.349143662466965,"Kids Line Cascade Bow Diaper Bag, Black","I purchased this in the black color.  For some reason this site is not allowing me to submit this review in the black color, so it's showing this as a review for the silver bag.  Just as a side note, the silver bag was the same price as the black and blush. One day after this review was initially posted online under the silver color, the price increased from twenty-nine and ninety nine to over seventy dollars and now includes free shipping and free returns.I really wanted to love this bag. However, when I first opened the box, I had knew this bag would have to be returned. I contacted the seller via Amazon and they were very easy to work with and provided no hassle in providing a prompt return authorization. However, when I went to the post office, the clerk let me know that even at the cheapest shipping rate, it would cost almost half the price of the bag in order for me to return it to the vendor due to the location from which it was going to be shipped. So, with that in mind, I decided to keep the bag. I will probably pass it on to someone with 1 child or a first time mother, or just use it as a purse.Here is what I like about the bag:1. It is beautiful and fashionable. The silver hardware is also nice. It doesn't look like a diaper bag.2. The handles seem to be well made.3. It comes with stroller straps.4. The changing pad is not padded. For me this would not be an issue, as it only means that it could be tossed into the washer to be cleaned when needed. A padded changing pad would not be as easy to machine wash without getting torn up.Here are the deal breakers for me on this bag:1. The bottom part of the bag I received is not sturdy at all. It's very thin and flimsy. The faux leather is also very wrinkled, as if it were glued on improperly and left to dry that way. When you sit the bag down it just falls down all over the place.2. A reveiwer stated the dimensions of the bag and its pockets. The bag I received has different dimensions. For example, it was stated that the back zippered pocket was 8x10. The back zippered pocket on the bag I received is actually 3x5. In fact, all of the pockets are too small and not deep enough. This translates into all of my things falling out withing the bag.3. I could not fit hardly anything in the pockets. I tried to fit just 2 pampers cruisers size 6 diapers into the largest pocket. It did not work at all. I could not fit the adjustable strap inside any of the pockets. Nor could I fit a bottle into the insulated pocket. The insulated pocket is extremely small and narrow. My hand would not even fit inside , and I have small hands.4. The pocket on the changing pad is sewn on crooked and is also much to small. I could not fit diapers or travel wipes or anything else in this pocket.5. I am minimalist. I like to keep diaper bag packing simple. I could NOT fit a blanket, change of clothes for baby and 2 year old, juice box and small snack, diapers, and wipes into this bag. The bag I received was not as large as others described. I have 2 small ones and a 3rd baby on the way. There is absolutely no way I could fit what's needed in here. I tried and it didn't work.6. This bag is heavy when empty. When filled, it's even more heavy on the shoulder. I'm not willing to sacrifice my shoulder for style. I need to be able to lift, and move young children and a baby quickly without having to contend with a heavy shoulder bag.This bag is actually made under the brand name Tiddliwinks and sells for seventy nine dollars and up at T-a-r-g-e-t and B-a-b-i-e-s R Us. I purchased this bag from this vendor for twenty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents without free shipping and free returns being offered.  Kidsline is not affiliated with this brand name. I called the T-a-r-g-e-t headquarters to get the comapany contact information to find out more and they said that kidsline is not the name of the company that makes this. So, I then went to the kidsline website. The website does not mention any diaper bags at all, only room decor and such. So, I'm now wondering if this bag is not a knock off of the original brand. This might explain why my bag seemed a little different from other reviewers. Regardless, the bag is cute. However, one can find more functional bags on clearance at T-a-r-g-e-t. If you want cute then buy this. If you also crave funcionality then look elsewhere.",2.0,I purchased this in the black color  For some reason this site is not allowing me to submit this review in the black color so its showing this as a review for the silver bag  Just as a side note the silver bag was the same price as the black and blush One day after this review was initially posted online under the silver color the price increased from twentynine and ninety nine to over seventy dollars and now includes free shipping and free returnsI really wanted to love this bag However when I first opened the box I had knew this bag would have to be returned I contacted the seller via Amazon and they were very easy to work with and provided no hassle in providing a prompt return authorization However when I went to the post office the clerk let me know that even at the cheapest shipping rate it would cost almost half the price of the bag in order for me to return it to the vendor due to the location from which it was going to be shipped So with that in mind I decided to keep the bag I will probably pass it on to someone with 1 child or a first time mother or just use it as a purseHere is what I like about the bag1 It is beautiful and fashionable The silver hardware is also nice It doesnt look like a diaper bag2 The handles seem to be well made3 It comes with stroller straps4 The changing pad is not padded For me this would not be an issue as it only means that it could be tossed into the washer to be cleaned when needed A padded changing pad would not be as easy to machine wash without getting torn upHere are the deal breakers for me on this bag1 The bottom part of the bag I received is not sturdy at all Its very thin and flimsy The faux leather is also very wrinkled as if it were glued on improperly and left to dry that way When you sit the bag down it just falls down all over the place2 A reveiwer stated the dimensions of the bag and its pockets The bag I received has different dimensions For example it was stated that the back zippered pocket was 8x10 The back zippered pocket on the bag I received is actually 3x5 In fact all of the pockets are too small and not deep enough This translates into all of my things falling out withing the bag3 I could not fit hardly anything in the pockets I tried to fit just 2 pampers cruisers size 6 diapers into the largest pocket It did not work at all I could not fit the adjustable strap inside any of the pockets Nor could I fit a bottle into the insulated pocket The insulated pocket is extremely small and narrow My hand would not even fit inside  and I have small hands4 The pocket on the changing pad is sewn on crooked and is also much to small I could not fit diapers or travel wipes or anything else in this pocket5 I am minimalist I like to keep diaper bag packing simple I could NOT fit a blanket change of clothes for baby and 2 year old juice box and small snack diapers and wipes into this bag The bag I received was not as large as others described I have 2 small ones and a 3rd baby on the way There is absolutely no way I could fit whats needed in here I tried and it didnt work6 This bag is heavy when empty When filled its even more heavy on the shoulder Im not willing to sacrifice my shoulder for style I need to be able to lift and move young children and a baby quickly without having to contend with a heavy shoulder bagThis bag is actually made under the brand name Tiddliwinks and sells for seventy nine dollars and up at Target and Babies R Us I purchased this bag from this vendor for twentynine dollars and ninetynine cents without free shipping and free returns being offered  Kidsline is not affiliated with this brand name I called the Target headquarters to get the comapany contact information to find out more and they said that kidsline is not the name of the company that makes this So I then went to the kidsline website The website does not mention any diaper bags at all only room decor and such So Im now wondering if this bag is not a knock off of the original brand This might explain why my bag seemed a little different from other reviewers Regardless the bag is cute However one can find more functional bags on clearance at Target If you want cute then buy this If you also crave funcionality then look elsewhere,-1.0

Unfortunately, they are buying a ""perception"".  Medical infant monitors have never been shown to save lives.This monitor makes no such claim but is obviously appealing to parents' perceptions that it can improve their child's safety or save their child's life.  To paraphrase a previous reviewer ""no amount of money is too much for your child's safety"".  A false claim- a product must actually improve safety for this claim to ring true.This product can actually cause harm-- example- mother picks up baby and is trying to breastfeed and didn't turn off monitor.  Monitor shrieking, baby at breast-- what to do?  Try not to drop baby as mother lunges for monitor controls! Or worse, putting baby on tummy to sleep because of the false sense of security from the monitor.For real safety-- reduce real SIDS risk factors- get prenatal care, breastfeed, don't smoke and put your child on its back to sleep.  This product is modern ""snake oil""- parents falsely feel secure but does nothing.Below are links to the evidence for this review that INFANT APNEA MONITORS HAVE NEVER BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TO PROTECT INFANTS FROM SIDS and may lead to a false sense of security.Here are some articles for those of you interested in evidence-based decision making and evidence based medicine.Start with JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association)- a 2001 article titled ""What Do Home Monitors Contribute to the SIDS Problem?""[...]Next is a quote from the journal CHEST- the professional journal for lung specialists.  [...]""Regrettably, there were no randomized or controlled studies of device efficacy for a life-saving role before monitors were made available to the public. Although there have been several studies456 on monitors regarding issues such as compliance, access to devices, quality of life, and duration of monitoring, few studies have examined whether cardiorespiratory apnea monitor devices were associated with a difference in outcome compared to the unmonitored infant, especially when the outcome measured was death. The high death rate of infants first using the home monitor1 should have alerted researchers to question whether the use of apnea monitors, alternative devices such as pulse oximeters, or any device could result in improved outcomes for infants at risk. In fact, one important study7 on national prevalence of apnea monitor use revealed two disturbing findings: a racial discrepancy for access to monitors, and that low-birth-weight black infants using monitors still had an odds ratio for SIDS of 3.93 compared to unmonitored infants. These studies raised a ""red flag"" that standard apnea monitors may not be life-saving devices, and that other risk factors such as low birth weight or race, and perhaps other devices might be the focus for increased targeted-prevention efforts. Regardless of the paucity of evidence for efficacy, home monitor use spiraled internationally in the last 35 years,8 but the incidence of SIDS did not decline until public education resulted in changes to modifiable SIDS risk factors in just the last 10 to 15 years.91011 .....The fear of sudden unexpected death in infants is understandably an emotional subject, leading to a desire by parents and providers to protect infants at risk, with the unfortunate result of a possible false sense of security offered by a device designed to detect limited types of events.

In the first step, I noticed the ""foot pieces"" did not attach as described in the instructions, and this is because the 3 pieces in question were supposed to be uniform to fit in the same manner in all 3 places.  But poor manufacturing threw that uniformity out of the window.  One piece fit fine, the second piece not so much, and the third piece not at all.  They're supposed to snap into place, but I noticed the 3 supposedly identical pieces slightly varied in size on the locking parts, causing one piece to fit where it was supposed to, but the other 2 not to.  All pieces on this product 'snap' into place using the old indented tab system for locking into slots.  These tabs are so flimsy and brittle, they cracked when trying to snap them into position.  And even the ones that didn't crack fit so loosely, I have serious choking concerns in how easy it'd be for a child to simply pull them loose.  Also, the little key ring items have cheap stickers on them that dissolve and flake off when you wash them.  Another choking concern.Finally, the musical element to this product, the little box with the mirror and 3 animals on it, suffers from faulty design that makes it unusable with the product.  Every other part to this product snaps into place, except for this one piece.  The assembly sheet instructs you to sit this piece into place and turn two 'keys' on the bottom side to lock it into place on the entertainment center, effectively forming a 'clamp' that locks the music box onto the center.  The problem is, the gap between the key and the bottom of the music box that forms this clamp lock is just under 1/8"" wide, and the slot you slide it into to turn the key and lock it onto has an edge that's a little over 1/4"" thick.  This makes it impossible to turn the key and lock the music box onto the entertainment center, as the instruction sheet clearly states you should be able to do.  Very poorly manufactured.  This makes the audio portion of the product essentially useless as a whole.  And I'd be willing to bet all units of this product suffer from the same faulty form.  I'm extremely disappointed not only with this, but the clear choking hazards I see with the other loose fitting parts and peeling, flaking, dissolving stickers on the key ring.  Will definitely be taking this product back for a full refund.  I can't stress enough how much anyone considering this product should steer clear of it.  Blatant failure of quality and safety control on the manufacturer's part.",1.0,First off I did manage to find this product for 20 less at the big box store than the price here Secondly this product is horribly manufactured  Absolute waste of money  The only thing Ill give it credit for is the assembly instruction sheet is as clear cut as Ive come across in assembleathome baby products  But thats where the quality ends  In the first step I noticed the foot pieces did not attach as described in the instructions and this is because the 3 pieces in question were supposed to be uniform to fit in the same manner in all 3 places  But poor manufacturing threw that uniformity out of the window  One piece fit fine the second piece not so much and the third piece not at all  Theyre supposed to snap into place but I noticed the 3 supposedly identical pieces slightly varied in size on the locking parts causing one piece to fit where it was supposed to but the other 2 not to  All pieces on this product snap into place using the old indented tab system for locking into slots  These tabs are so flimsy and brittle they cracked when trying to snap them into position  And even the ones that didnt crack fit so loosely I have serious choking concerns in how easy itd be for a child to simply pull them loose  Also the little key ring items have cheap stickers on them that dissolve and flake off when you wash them  Another choking concernFinally the musical element to this product the little box with the mirror and 3 animals on it suffers from faulty design that makes it unusable with the product  Every other part to this product snaps into place except for this one piece  The assembly sheet instructs you to sit this piece into place and turn two keys on the bottom side to lock it into place on the entertainment center effectively forming a clamp that locks the music box onto the center  The problem is the gap between the key and the bottom of the music box that forms this clamp lock is just under 18 wide and the slot you slide it into to turn the key and lock it onto has an edge thats a little over 14 thick  This makes it impossible to turn the key and lock the music box onto the entertainment center as the instruction sheet clearly states you should be able to do  Very poorly manufactured  This makes the audio portion of the product essentially useless as a whole  And Id be willing to bet all units of this product suffer from the same faulty form  Im extremely disappointed not only with this but the clear choking hazards I see with the other loose fitting parts and peeling flaking dissolving stickers on the key ring  Will definitely be taking this product back for a full refund  I cant stress enough how much anyone considering this product should steer clear of it  Blatant failure of quality and safety control on the manufacturers part,-1.0
