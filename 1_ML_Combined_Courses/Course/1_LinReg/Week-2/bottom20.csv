It only shows part of the screen making it impossible to read any information on the monitor - which defeats the purpose of using it.My wife emailed VTech and was given a prompt response that she would be contacted within 48 hours by a CSR.  2 weeks later she sent another email and finally was given a response in broken English on how to fix it.We went through the process given to us to try and fix it and still no luck, so we emailed back telling them that we tried it a few times and still are having the same issues.We then received an email back with the same instructions on how to fix it.We are now waiting on another email back on the next steps, which will probably be the same instructions on how to try and fix it....I will update this if we ever get a proper response back from VTech.  For now I would not recommend this product as it didn't even last 6 months and dealing with their customer service has been a terrible experience.UPDATE:We finally got a response back from VTech and they want us to ship the broken unit to them on our dime. Two issues with this: why should it cost us when it is still under warranty and their defective product, and we can't go without the parent unit for weeks and we ship back and wait for a new unit.I asked them to send the new unit along with a return mailing label and we will gladly mail it back - they refused.I am not one to complain, but dealing with VTech has been the worse experience in a very long time. I own a business and couldn't imagine treating my clients this way, especially when it's my product that is the issue.We have told VTech that unless they ship a new unit first we will just go ahead and purchase a different product through a company that stands behind their products.DO NOT buy from VTECH, unless you like headaches.",1,First the distance on these are no more than 75 feet  which is much different that the advertised distanceSecondly the screen on ours has been having issues  It only shows part of the screen making it impossible to read any information on the monitor  which defeats the purpose of using itMy wife emailed VTech and was given a prompt response that she would be contacted within 48 hours by a CSR  2 weeks later she sent another email and finally was given a response in broken English on how to fix itWe went through the process given to us to try and fix it and still no luck so we emailed back telling them that we tried it a few times and still are having the same issuesWe then received an email back with the same instructions on how to fix itWe are now waiting on another email back on the next steps which will probably be the same instructions on how to try and fix itI will update this if we ever get a proper response back from VTech  For now I would not recommend this product as it didnt even last 6 months and dealing with their customer service has been a terrible experienceUPDATEWe finally got a response back from VTech and they want us to ship the broken unit to them on our dime Two issues with this why should it cost us when it is still under warranty and their defective product and we cant go without the parent unit for weeks and we ship back and wait for a new unitI asked them to send the new unit along with a return mailing label and we will gladly mail it back  they refusedI am not one to complain but dealing with VTech has been the worse experience in a very long time I own a business and couldnt imagine treating my clients this way especially when its my product that is the issueWe have told VTech that unless they ship a new unit first we will just go ahead and purchase a different product through a company that stands behind their productsDO NOT buy from VTECH unless you like headaches,-1
13725,-19.69905629197382,"Peg-Perego Tatamia High Chair, White Latte","I can see why there are so many good reviews on this high chair.  The design looks great, the seat covering is easy to clean, the base folds up, and it can be used as a swing for infants.  I felt this was a great purchase too when we first brought it home.  6 months later, my opinion on this chair has changed quite a bit.The first thing I noticed right out of the box was that the entire thing is made of plastic.  The only metal parts on this chair are the screws and a few internal cables and rods.  As long as the plastic is sturdy enough, it should be fine however, there are a few stress points on the chair that I feel should have used a different material or at least a stronger piece of plastic.  After 6 months of use, I've noticed that the tray is beginning to sag noticeably from its own weight.  Any round object will roll to the far end of the tray.  For a $300 chair, one would expect the use of better materials.The base is folded up by lifting a plastic lever on each side of the chair.  About 3 months after purchase, the cable that is attached to one of levers popped off.  We rarely folded up the base so I figured it wasn't a major problem since at least the side that we push against the wall still worked.  Then about 5 months after the purchase, the other side popped off.  Now both sides of the base cannot be folded up.  As hard as I tried, the cables could not be reattached.  I also noticed that the lever on the back of the chair that allows you to recline the seat is very hard to pull.  It feels like the plastic lever is bending and ready to snap from the tension of the cable.  Unless the lever is pulled all the way, the seat will not recline.I would not recommend using the swing feature to anyone unless your baby is very young and cannot move their arms around.  My baby was just beginning to learn how to move his arms to touch things by the time we purchased this chair.  He was still well within the recommended weight limit for the swing so we gave it a try.  As he was swinging, he tried touching one of the arms that was attached to the seat and got his fingers pinched.  The arms that are attached to the chair crosses very closely to the arms that are attached to the base.  As the chair swings, there is a very strong possibility that a child will get their fingers pinched or even seriously crushed between the two arms.  The clearance between the two arms as they cross is very small.  Its almost like a scissor action with two arms crossing back and forth well within reach of the child.  Needless to say, we never used the swing after the first try.I finally called the Peg-Perego customer service line regarding the broken levers and was told they would be sending me replacement arms for the chair but I would have to dissemble the chair myself to replace them.  There are no repair locations in my area so I have no choice.  They also informed me that they would have to get back to me on the total shipping and handling charge for the replacement parts.  Yes, they even charge you for handling.  I can't wait to find out how much this warranty fix is going to cost me.UPDATEIts been a week and I still haven't heard back from the Peg-Perego customer service dept on the shipping & handling charge for the replacement parts.  Just this morning, the plastic cover on the piece that the t-bar attaches to fell off while we were placing our baby in the chair.  We were not using the t-bar and rarely do.  It took me several minutes to find the small metal spring that was underneath the button on the cover.  The small metal spring is a choking hazard and had my wife not noticed the cover falling off, our baby could have found it before us.  I just emailed them again to follow up on the first call and to report this new issue.2ND UPDATEAfter another email and a follow up call, I spoke their customer service and was told the shipping and handling would be $30.  I asked if the arms would come with instructions on how to disassemble and reassemble the chair and was told that the instructions that came with the chair should show me how.  After I hung up, I looked through the manual and could not find any instructions on this.  I guess I will have to see if I can figure it out on my own when the parts arrive.3RD UPDATEI received the replacement part about a week and a half after they charged my credit card.  They ended up sending the entire base and arms so no major disassembling was required.  The seat and wheels were easily removed from the old chair and attached to the new base.  The customer service rep said the part they were sending would also address the other two issues of the sagging tray and the t-bar base cover falling off but it does not.  The slots that the tray is inserted into and the t-bar base cover are totally separate from the base they sent to me.  I decided to just live with the sagging tray and wrapped the cover back on with strong tape after removing the button and spring.",2,I can see why there are so many good reviews on this high chair

20561,-19.79813011966122,Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor with Room Temperature Thermometer,"DO NOT BUY THIS BABY MONITOR!I purchased this monitor in February and after only two months of use the video camera stopped working.  Since it was under warranty, I contacted Motorola and started the warranty process.  I was told it would be 24 hours and I would receive an email on where and how to send the non-working monitor back.  It took six days and two additional phone calls just to get that information.  After sending it back, I contacted the motorola representative by email to let her know that the monitor had been returned and based on my tracking information it had been received by them two days prior.  She asked for the tracking number which I emailed to her that same day.  I then waited for seven days and never received a return email.  I emailed her again and asked for an ETA on my new monitor and still never recieved a response.  I then called Motorola again and was told that the replacement monitors were on back order and it would be at least six to eight weeks before they would be in.  Then the motorola representative explaned to me that they were being shipped from Korea and that was a really long way from the US.  Now she had really made me mad!  I called again and finally spoke to someone who knew what was going on and she told me that they should have sent me out a different model as a temporary replacement until the others came in and that she would get one sent out that day.  Funny thing is, is that when I finally recieved the monitor in the mail, it was the same model that they claimed was on backorder.Well, now here we are less than a month and a half since I recieved my replacement monitor and now the parent unit has stopped charging.  We can't even use it plugged in.  It seems as though the charging cord and the monitor itself are not connecting.  So, here I am with another non-working baby monitor.  I think I have spent more time without this monitor working than the amount of time I have actually had it working.  I am very dissapointed in the quality of this product and the customer service that Motorola has provided.  I am currently waiting for a call back from the representative I spoke to this morning, so I will see how it goes this time around.",1,DO NOT BUY THIS BABY MONITORI purchased this monitor in February and after only two months of use the video camera stopped working  Since it was under warranty I contacted Motorola and started the warranty process  I was told it would be 24 hours and I would receive an email on where and how to send the nonworking monitor back  It took six days and two additional phone calls just to get that information  After sending it back I contacted the motorola representative by email to let her know that the monitor had been returned and based on my tracking information it had been received by them two days prior  She asked for the tracking number which I emailed to her that same day  I then waited for seven days and never received a return email  I emailed her again and asked for an ETA on my new monitor and still never recieved a response  I then called Motorola again and was told that the replacement monitors were on back order and it would be at least six to eight weeks before they would be in  Then the motorola representative explaned to me that they were being shipped from Korea and that was a really long way from the US  Now she had really made me mad  I called again and finally spoke to someone who knew what was going on and she told me that they should have sent me out a different model as a temporary replacement until the others came in and that she would get one sent out that day  Funny thing is is that when I finally recieved the monitor in the mail it was the same model that they claimed was on backorderWell now here we are less than a month and a half since I recieved my replacement monitor and now the parent unit has stopped charging  We cant even use it plugged in  It seems as though the charging cord and the monitor itself are not connecting  So here I am with another nonworking baby monitor  I think I have spent more time without this monitor working than the amount of time I have actually had it working  I am very dissapointed in the quality of this product and the customer service that Motorola has provided  I am currently waiting for a call back from the representative I spoke to this morning so I will see how it goes this time around,-1

In fact, I've never written one of these reviews before, but I used them to research products when I was registering and I had to take the time to write one now and try to warn others.  I have been using the Avent bottles since my son was born 9 weeks ago and I have never been so dissatisfied with a product!  These bottles LEAK!  They are awful.  I just had a nightmare 3am feeding (actually all 3am feedings are nightmares, but this one was even worse than usual!).  The bottle leaked all over my son, me, my floor, my table.  I had to interrupt my son's feeding several times to wash him off and try to stop the flow of milk onto my floor- I even had to change his bib 3 times because it had soaked through.  These leaks seem to happen all the time- I have actually thrown out one or two bottles, hoping that there was a strange, abnormal ""defect"" with one of the bottles or the nipple, etc, but NO- these bottles are just leaking!  Don't waste the time or money- try something else.",1,Its 3am in the morning and needless to say this is NOT the time that I would normally choose to be on the computer writing an online review  In fact Ive never written one of these reviews before but I used them to research products when I was registering and I had to take the time to write one now and try to warn others  I have been using the Avent bottles since my son was born 9 weeks ago and I have never been so dissatisfied with a product  These bottles LEAK  They are awful  I just had a nightmare 3am feeding actually all 3am feedings are nightmares but this one was even worse than usual  The bottle leaked all over my son me my floor my table  I had to interrupt my sons feeding several times to wash him off and try to stop the flow of milk onto my floor I even had to change his bib 3 times because it had soaked through  These leaks seem to happen all the time I have actually thrown out one or two bottles hoping that there was a strange abnormal defect with one of the bottles or the nipple etc but NO these bottles are just leaking  Dont waste the time or money try something else,-1
17398,-20.102511797584143,"Baby Jogger Summit XC Double Stroller, Red/Black","Received Jogger as a shower gift so it sat in the box for nearly a year.  Once i started using stroller it was almost 2 weeks before the 1 year manufacture warranty expired.  Everything seemed great, full suspension, deep sun visors, and four wheels for more stability.  that is where it ends, quality for nearly a $700 stroller is lacking.  The frame looks molded like a high tech mountain bike but the break system failed 2 months into light operation, the wheels were warp easily, the material on the stroller feels like a cheap book bag and the child harness is plastic and has already broken.  it boggles the mind that this stroller is $649, but the warranty will make up for all the concerns right???NoI go to dicks with receipt in hand and the deny every selling it.  Dicks sporting goods stopped carrying this entire line due to quality concerns.  So i contact the manufacturer and that is where the fun begins they have a lifetime warranty but it is only as good as the company who backs it.  Customer service here is terrible I was told after numerous attempts to remedy the warped wheels that my 1 year warranty has expired.  I start listing the numerous problems with the stroller and the women at customer service says that none of that is covered outside the 1 year manufactures warranty.

30321,-20.252840674983375,"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","Reviewers. You failed me!This thing worked for 24 hours, then went ""out of range"" and would not operate at all. To be clear, it was not out of range.Samsung's website wasn't helpful. So I called customer service and waited on hold for half an hour.  Finally, I got the lone call center worker, and he told me I had to go online and fill out a form, and get a service ticket, and they'd get back to me eventually with information on where to ship the faulty device. He told me ""this is a known issue.""  I asked how many days until it would be replaced and he didn't know.  I asked why are they still being sold if they don't work and he said ""It is more expensive for Samsung to collect the faulty monitors than it is for us to wait for them to be returned.""  He also told me that Samsung sells the monitors again when they are returned. They are repackaged and sent out to the market again.  Even though they are known to be faulty.I'm now boycotting Samsung, as I would for any company that knowingly sells a faulty baby safety product. Their customer service was pretty dire.  To his credit, the Samsung rep I spoked to admitted that Samsung was doing something pretty shady.  But he was remorseless. I've concluded I'm one of many who got duped.UPDATE a few days later:I got a full refund from this seller. Thank you seller! I expected to be hassled over the return, but when I got it instantly, I regretted mailing the monitor back to you wrapped in a diaper. Sometimes I am just not very subtle. I apologize.Another update: To replace this monitor, I ordered a Levana Astra 3.5"" PTZ Digital Baby Video Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom 32006.  It was EVEN WORSE than this one -see my review of it if you are interested.Another update: I received several phone calls from polite, concerned Samsung personnel over this matter in the immediate aftermath of this review's posting.  I made an attempt to return one of the calls, but the callback number directed me to a main Samsung line with a lot of electronic options. Then, I got a letter of apology from the Technical Support staff who had treated my situation with indifference, and a letter from his supervisor.  Both letters apologized for my experience, and both sought to clarify the information that I was given in error, and my misunderstanding of some of it. The letter from the unpleasant technical support worker was especially humble. I was kindly, but aggressively, asked to remove the negative content of my review but I have decided to leave it as is so that shoppers can see real feedback of this product. I did change my headline to reflect my less annoyed position on this consumer experience. ""Iffy"" has replaced ""faulty.""What I know now is:-Samsung does not re-sell refurbished products that are unlabeled as being refurbished.  They proudly operate in accordance with laws regarding such products. The info I was given that made me believe that was a misspeak on the part of the technician.  He was referring to vendors who re-sell broken Samsung products, not Samsung. (Note: I do not suspect this Amazon seller of doing such a thing)-Samsung believes that my monitor came with information on how to ""easily resolve"" the pairing problem I experienced. So, while Samsung is saying that my unit isn't a problematic model with known issues, it....is a problematic mode with known issues.-My manual did not have pairing information, however. It declared that the monitor comes already paired, and that was the end of it.  (Other owners, do you have this in your user manual?)  Anyway, if that information was in there, why did the technician I spoke with tell me I needed to mail my unit back to get the pairing problem resolved? He could have just given me the directions on how to fix it. He specifically stated that my model had to be sent away to be repaired, and that this was a known issue.-Therefore, my complaint still stands. Samsung retailers are distributing a product that isn't working for some people. Samsung failed to provide technical support when I needed it. And while they are overall very nice, and very friendly, and while I do still like Samsung products, I still had to deal with a product that didn't work, and had a bad customer service experience.  Those are facts.  Will I boycott Samsung? No.  And I don't think you should either.  But this isn't the Most Unexceptional baby monitor on the market.  There is room for improvement.To Samsung: You can have another star if you please stop contacting me!  Thank you for the Starbucks gift card!*****************Update over a month later: Samsung is calling me repeatedly, despite being told several times to leave me alone. Samsung: you cannot harass me into giving your product a better review.  Today I told you to stop calling and I removed a star for my trouble.PS I have had a Motorola baby monitor for about a month now, and it works great!

That makes me wonder about the accuracy of the ones it does give.Edited on 12-7-11 to add:  Today, it took me 3 hours to figure out that the extremely annoying high pitched whine coming from some object in my son's room was, in fact, coming from this thermometer. It nearly drove me insane first. It had to be from the battery being dead, but this was not mentioned in the instruction book. I cannot stress to you enough just how head-splittingly-annoying this was. I hope that whoever designed this has to listen to this sound for the rest of their natural life and that they live to be 150. I had to check everything in the general area of the sound because there wasn't any blinking light on the thermometer to call my attention to it specifically. I unplugged the clock - nope, not that. I checked the phone line - nope, not that. I looked for a bullet hole from a hunter - nope, not that. I moved the antenna for our satellite radio - nope, not that. I turned off every single electronic device in the room - nope, wasn't those. I was finally removing every object from the room when I discovered that the thermometer was the infernal device for which I was looking. The noise stopped when it hit the wall. I am well known to throw like a girl, but I threw this -------- device hard enough to pop off the battery cover (no, I didn't have a COIN in the bedroom of my toddler with which to turn it). You have absolutely no idea how much consternation this caused in our house this morning. My head is still splitting from the noise this thermometer made. Our dogs still won't go upstairs.

I am an experienced high chair user as have raised two other children and also work with infants and toddlers professionally. I also ordered the green cotton seat cover and toy bar.HAZARDS1. The ""swing"" feature, as other reviewers have pointed out, can very easily trap a baby's arm. We tried it once but this was such an obvious risk that I couldn't imagine using it.2. Within two months of starting to use the high chair, the internal cables that are supposed to keep the tray table latched on to the chair began to fail. I noticed that the tray began sagging. Within a few weeks of daily use, the tray began to either slide down and fall off spontaneously (staying latched on one side and dangling on the other), or could be kicked off by my active 7 month old with no warning whatsoever. On several occasions, she kicked off the tray, sending dishes and food flying, and in one instance knocking a cup of hot tea out of my hand. Fortunately I was standing far enough away that she was not burned, but I can easily imagine some disastrous scenarios.3. At this point, we gave up on using the tray and just fed her in the high chair using a nearby countertop for her food, spoons, etc. However, I soon realized that the non-wipeable nature of the cotton cover was causing me to hold back from letting her make a big old baby self-feeding mess with bits of mashed fruit, etc.I went to a store and bought a Chicco Polly chair, which was cheaper than this and has a wipeable cover and a rock-solid tray. I haven't looked back. I am sorry that I wasted the money and effort on the Tatamia and am honestly amazed that it hasn't been recalled yet. It seems like a very flawed product to me.We ended up throwing out the tray from the Tatamia and now use it as a booster chair so that our daughter can sit at table with the family at mealtimes.

So right there this unit cost me more money and for what I paid, I should have been able to hook it up and go that day.  It never quite *didn't* leak.  At first, I thought the random drip I would get was from the pressure fitting, then the fitting at the tank and eventually I just rested the whole hose inside a trash can to contain the random brief leaking that happened every time I'd use it.  After a emergency toilet repair in which the unit was removed and reinstalled, my husband (who has plumbing experience) insisted there must be a fitting missing.  We looked everywhere.  Nothing was missing.  He picked up flat washers, conical washers, we tried it all.  The cone washers according to him should have fixed the leak.  Nothing we have tried has fixed the now stream-like leak that comes from the fitting that secures to the toilet.  Now I have a $45 sprayer sitting on my bathroom floor that is completely useless.

Please read all the way through- SERIOUS DANGER.I could not figure out how to get the recline to work on the chair. Turns out the bar with the recline button wasn't working. I called Baby Trend who sent me postage to return it. I had to pay for the packaging though since I had thrown the box away. Before I picked that option I had tried exchanging it at Babies R Us first and the display recline wasn't working. They even went out of their way to open a new one in the box and it wasn't working either. I called Baby Trend to confirm, yet again, that the bar the recline button is on is supposed to move (two different agents at Baby Trend confirmed this.) It's a bad sign when 3 seats in one store are not working.  I was thrilled about this seat because it's truly easy to install; however, it's supposed to be in the most recline position for a newborn and once it's in my car it needs to be adjusted to the most recline position and there's no way the seat is adjusting to that level. I received a new seat from the company two days after my son was born. (I had to call multiple times to get them to speed this process up. I held on the phone for 40 minutes at one point. They weren't going to even send it that fast knowing my son was arriving.) The seat arrived from the manufacturer and it was working at that time. I did request them to test it before it was sent to me. They even said, ""we test the ones we send from here but the ones from the factory are not tested)The icing on the cake here!!! After just four weeks of using the seat I went to remove my son from the seat and the chest clip broke!!! This is a very frightening issue. It literally just snapped off while I was removing him. I don't even want to think of what could have happened if this seat would have been involved in an accident.

9630,-22.098712234224124,Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor,"We bought this baby monitor to replace a different kind that had stopped working.  When it arrived, I liked it's sleek and modern design.  However, that was about all I liked about it.1)  When I went to install the battery, I lost the TINY screw that is used to close the compartment.  I am wondering if there might have been a better way to design this, using a slightly larger screw or put it in a better location so I could have held onto it a little more easily.2)  I noticed the slight static/hissing sound coming across the monitor, even when the base was in a silent room.  The strange thing is, the sound of the hissing gradually got louder and louder over the course of the first week I had it!  By the end of the week, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I unplugged the thing and submitted a return order to Amazon.3)  When trying to deal with the static, I tried turning the volume all the way down and relying on the lights.  It has bars of light that illuminate when sound is picked up on the base unit.  Unfortunately, the lights are so faint, I could barely see them when the parent unit was in a room that had any lighting.  I am usually only in a dark room when I am sleeping, and at that time, I obviously can't rely on the bars of lights.  I needed sound.  Unfortunately, the sound coming across the parent unit was obnoxious and unacceptable (see #2), so nothing worked for us.4)  This is strange.  When you plug the parent unit in to charge, the power light blinks when charging.  It's actually quite bright!  It stops blinking when it is plugged in and fully charged, or when it is unplugged (even if it is not fully charged).  I kept the charger plugged in by my nightstand, but found it very annoying to have that bright flashing light by me overnight.  I had to cover it to keep it from being a distraction while trying to sleep.5)  Speaking the flashing power light while charging, I found it strange that this baby monitor did not give any indication of when the battery was getting low or dead altogether.  One day, I had the parent unit sitting out (unplugged) while I worked around the house and the baby napped.  At some point--maybe when I heard the baby talking to herself in her room but couldn't hear a peep over the baby monitor--I realized it had died.  It didn't beep or flash lights or do anything to let me know it wad dying or dead.  What if I had gone outside to do some yard work, relying on the baby monitor to hear when my baby woke or needed me?  That was not good.That's all I can think of off-hand.

8793,-23.326203083675246,"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 1 White, Slow Flow (0-3 months)","I will try to write an objective review of the bottle itself - as much as I can. For that let me start out with the premise: whether or not your baby takes the bottle or not has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself, babies are human beings, though small, and have their likes and dislikes, which will include nipple size, shape, feel of the material the nipple is made from, etc. Since I am reviewing the BOTTLE ITSELF it follows that my baby did eat from it. This was the first bottle I gave my son - I really wanted it to work - and he refused to take a Playtex bottle.PROS:1) Of course, their biggest selling point: the bottles are BPA and polycarbonate free. In this day and age when we still do not know what causes developmental disorders like autism, I figure it is better to expose your child to as few chemicals as you can.2) The material from which it is made is much more life-like and looks more like the real nipples (at least the ones I have!).3) Compared to other bottles (like Playtex and Avent) the nipple is actually pretty small and it might be more convenient for a small baby to hold and not choke.CONS:1) As one reviewer already mentioned, to fill the bottle you have to close it with a lid and invert it to fill from the bottom; the nipple does not close well and would constantly leak, so you have to be very quick about pouring - closing - inverting, and it is DEFINITELY not a one hand operation. Afterwards the spilled contents would drip from the bottle and the inside of the lid would be all dirty. Very annoying.2) Because of the shape of the bottle and nipple - very small nipple that turns into a wide portion very abruptly - you need a fair amount of access liquid in the bottle for your baby not to start swallowing air. I feed my son with pumped breast milk and I found it very annoying that I had to waste so much of it - at least 1 oz. No matter what they say, when the level of milk gets low those ""petals"" are absolutely useless.3) You can not put this bottle into a bottle-warmer and warming up milk in it under running water is impossible: the walls are very thick on the bottom and it takes too long, and if you cover the bottle with a lid - forget about it. I had to warm up milk in a separate container - like a milk storage bag - and then pour it into the bottle.4) The fact that the small nipple turns into a wide opened bottle so abruptly means that there is no place for a baby to establish a good vacuum seal for suction. My son kept making ""kissing"" noises when he ate, a tell-tale sign of air ingestion, and you could see that the corners of his mouth where completely open and unused. This design is not natural, actually, since babies are supposed to take in a large portion of areola as well as the nipple, which causes the nipple to elongate and form more of a cone shape.5) Probably due to the problem mentioned in point 4 above and the fact that this silicone is very soft, I discovered that this material is not very durable. After about a week of using the bottle (I bought only one to try out) one morning as I was trying to fill it with milk I noticed a residue around the nipple where the wide portion of the bottle starts. At first I thought that I did not wash it well, so I started to scrub the bottle again - residue did not come off. After looking at the bottle closer I realized that it was frayed silicone!!! My 3.5-week-old son - read toothless - started rubbing through the bottle with his gums! At this price for each bottle if I had to get a new one after each week...well need I say more.I am very grateful to this bottle for being a transition from breast, but one week and 1.5 days is all it took to give it up. One afternoon as I was feeding my son he kept constantly loosing suction on the nipple and would start rooting in frustration to grab it again (even though when we started using this bottle he also fell asleep when feeding, just like with the breast). After a while both of us got tired and annoyed, he started crying and I went and got the Playtex bottle with disposable liners (also chemical free, by the way!!!), which he has refused to take initially. I poured the milk from Adiri into this Playtex bottle and we have been happy ever since!!! I use a Playtex pump, so I can pump directly into these liners and store the milk in them, warming up takes less than 1 minute under running water - very useful in the middle of the night- and my baby seems to be more comfortable and he is ingesting MUCH less air.In short, the bottle has MANY design flaws, but who knows what your baby will like and how well this bottle will fit with his/her feeding style (especially if your baby refuses to take any other bottle). It is worth trying it out, but buy one bottle and see how it goes. Good luck!!!!!!!",2,I will try to write an objective review of the bottle itself  as much as I can For that let me start out with the premise whether or not your baby takes the bottle or not has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself babies are human beings though small and have their likes and dislikes which will include nipple size shape feel of the material the nipple is made from etc Since I am reviewing the BOTTLE ITSELF it follows that my baby did eat from it This was the first bottle I gave my son  I really wanted it to work  and he refused to take a Playtex bottlePROS1 Of course their biggest selling point the bottles are BPA and polycarbonate free In this day and age when we still do not know what causes developmental disorders like autism I figure it is better to expose your child to as few chemicals as you can2 The material from which it is made is much more lifelike and looks more like the real nipples at least the ones I have3 Compared to other bottles like Playtex and Avent the nipple is actually pretty small and it might be more convenient for a small baby to hold and not chokeCONS1 As one reviewer already mentioned to fill the bottle you have to close it with a lid and invert it to fill from the bottom the nipple does not close well and would constantly leak so you have to be very quick about pouring  closing  inverting and it is DEFINITELY not a one hand operation Afterwards the spilled contents would drip from the bottle and the inside of the lid would be all dirty Very annoying2 Because of the shape of the bottle and nipple  very small nipple that turns into a wide portion very abruptly  you need a fair amount of access liquid in the bottle for your baby not to start swallowing air I feed my son with pumped breast milk and I found it very annoying that I had to waste so much of it  at least 1 oz No matter what they say when the level of milk gets low those petals are absolutely useless3 You can not put this bottle into a bottlewarmer and warming up milk in it under running water is impossible the walls are very thick on the bottom and it takes too long and if you cover the bottle with a lid  forget about it I had to warm up milk in a separate container  like a milk storage bag  and then pour it into the bottle4 The fact that the small nipple turns into a wide opened bottle so abruptly means that there is no place for a baby to establish a good vacuum seal for suction My son kept making kissing noises when he ate a telltale sign of air ingestion and you could see that the corners of his mouth where completely open and unused This design is not natural actually since babies are supposed to take in a large portion of areola as well as the nipple which causes the nipple to elongate and form more of a cone shape5 Probably due to the problem mentioned in point 4 above and the fact that this silicone is very soft I discovered that this material is not very durable After about a week of using the bottle I bought only one to try out one morning as I was trying to fill it with milk I noticed a residue around the nipple where the wide portion of the bottle starts At first I thought that I did not wash it well so I started to scrub the bottle again  residue did not come off After looking at the bottle closer I realized that it was frayed silicone My 35weekold son  read toothless  started rubbing through the bottle with his gums At this price for each bottle if I had to get a new one after each weekwell need I say moreI am very grateful to this bottle for being a transition from breast but one week and 15 days is all it took to give it up One afternoon as I was feeding my son he kept constantly loosing suction on the nipple and would start rooting in frustration to grab it again even though when we started using this bottle he also fell asleep when feeding just like with the breast After a while both of us got tired and annoyed he started crying and I went and got the Playtex bottle with disposable liners also chemical free by the way which he has refused to take initially I poured the milk from Adiri into this Playtex bottle and we have been happy ever since I use a Playtex pump so I can pump directly into these liners and store the milk in them warming up takes less than 1 minute under running water  very useful in the middle of the night and my baby seems to be more comfortable and he is ingesting MUCH less airIn short the bottle has MANY design flaws but who knows what your baby will like and how well this bottle will fit with hisher feeding style especially if your baby refuses to take any other bottle It is worth trying it out but buy one bottle and see how it goes Good luck,-1
21667,-27.2858601831413,Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),"This is the first review I have ever written out of the many things I have purchased through amazon.  I write this because I feel very strongly about the poor quality levana products and feel people should have a heads up about what they are getting.When my baby was first born, I originally bought the basic levana babyview 20 and it worked well until right after 1 year.  The antennae broke off exposing the wire underneath it, the kickstand on the monitor broke off...so I contacted levana customer service.  I couldn't get through to them via phone so I emailed.  Didn't hear back for a few weeks, then emailed them again.  They pretty much told me that because it had been longer than a year, it was a ""too bad, so sad"" situation.  The monitor seemed to function for several months and I decided instead of buying a new one, I would try to wait it out.  Then shortly thereafter, it was making a very loud noise that I couldn't sleep with it on.  The monitor was not mishandled or dropped...just generally used and it still fell apart so fast.After looking and looking for a new monitor, I kept coming back to this levana item because of the lower price with all the bells and whistles (talk talk to baby, temperature, etc).  Originally when I first started looking, I remember there being a lot more reviews, with half negative, half positive ones for this item but after about a week, all the reviews were wiped out and there were only 4 reviews with 5 stars.  I fooled myself into thinking maybe this was a much better product, and for the price and free shipping, I decided on it.IT IS A TERRIBLE MONITOR!  IF YOU WANT TO SEE FROZEN IMAGES OF YOUR BABY AND NOT LIVE VIDEO, DO NOT GET THIS MONITOR.  The battery life is terrible, the image quality is poor (blue, blurry images). The ""talk to baby"" function makes your voice sound like a monster.  I don't even use it because is TERRIFIES my baby.  THe only nice thing about it is tells you the temperature of the room.I am in the process of contacting CSN to see if I can return this.  I won't be purchasing levana again.  Maybe I got a bad monitor, or maybe they just put our poor products assembled in China. You get what you pay for and if you think this is a good deal, think again.Also shady that Amazon removes reviews at their lesiure.  Who knows, they might not like this honest review and not even post it in which case I won't purchase anything from amazon again.",1,This is the first review I have ever written out of the many things I have purchased through amazon  I write this because I feel very strongly about the poor quality levana products and feel people should have a heads up about what they are gettingWhen my baby was first born I originally bought the basic levana babyview 20 and it worked well until right after 1 year  The antennae broke off exposing the wire underneath it the kickstand on the monitor broke offso I contacted levana customer service  I couldnt get through to them via phone so I emailed  Didnt hear back for a few weeks then emailed them again  They pretty much told me that because it had been longer than a year it was a too bad so sad situation  The monitor seemed to function for several months and I decided instead of buying a new one I would try to wait it out  Then shortly thereafter it was making a very loud noise that I couldnt sleep with it on  The monitor was not mishandled or droppedjust generally used and it still fell apart so fastAfter looking and looking for a new monitor I kept coming back to this levana item because of the lower price with all the bells and whistles talk talk to baby temperature etc  Originally when I first started looking I remember there being a lot more reviews with half negative half positive ones for this item but after about a week all the reviews were wiped out and there were only 4 reviews with 5 stars  I fooled myself into thinking maybe this was a much better product and for the price and free shipping I decided on itIT IS A TERRIBLE MONITOR  IF YOU WANT TO SEE FROZEN IMAGES OF YOUR BABY AND NOT LIVE VIDEO DO NOT GET THIS MONITOR  The battery life is terrible the image quality is poor blue blurry images The talk to baby function makes your voice sound like a monster  I dont even use it because is TERRIFIES my baby  THe only nice thing about it is tells you the temperature of the roomI am in the process of contacting CSN to see if I can return this  I wont be purchasing levana again  Maybe I got a bad monitor or maybe they just put our poor products assembled in China You get what you pay for and if you think this is a good deal think againAlso shady that Amazon removes reviews at their lesiure  Who knows they might not like this honest review and not even post it in which case I wont purchase anything from amazon again,-1
28135,-27.293036154419394,VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sounds Full Color Video and Audio Monitor,"This is my second video monitoring system, the first being a Summer Infant Day and Night that we purchased in 2010 when our first child was born.  The Summer Infant model was (and still is) excellent.  The picture and sound quality are both great, and reliable.  But, as luck has it, that model is not expandable, and we're expecting our second child, so we decided to switch to a model that supported multiple cameras.  In terms of rave reviews and features, I should have gone with one of the Motorola models, but I was amazed by the bundle of features for the price with VTech, and took the bait.  We bought this system and one extra camera, and went to work setting them up at home in the nursery, and in the toddler's room.First, the picture quality is NOT GOOD.  Compared to the Summer Infant, it's a joke, especially the night vision.  Luckily my son has dark hair or I'd never be able to GUESS where he was in the picture.  If you need crisp images, do not get this model.  We're making do so far, as we can mostly tell where the toddler is in the picture, but it's terrible.Second, the sound quality and reliability is NOT GOOD.  The Summer Infant has crisp, continuous sound.  The VTech sound is tinny at best, and interference interrupts it every couple of seconds, in no particular pattern.  Moreover, the sound seems to turn itself OFF all the time.  I've been able to jog it back on by using the ""Talk"" feature to say something over the intercom to my son, and then the sound kicks back on awaiting his response.  Again, we're using it for him, but it's terrible.We have not used this yet for a newborn, and it's quite likely that we won't.  We still have our old Summer Infant, and unless the sound is continuous and the close-up picture is much better (the newborn camera will only be pointed at a crib, whereas the toddler camera is mounted up high for a (poor quality) view of the whole room) we'll probably use the Summer Infant for the newborn, as I'm not messing around with an unreliable system for a new baby.  If we end up going that route, I'll mount the extra VTech camera in toddler's room for added viewer angles, as we can't see the whole room with one camera, and I'll just tote around both parent units, one for each child.If I had known I was going to have to do that, I'd just have purchased another Summer Infant Day and Night.Morale of the story: if I had this to do over, I wouldn't have made this choice.  The product is trash compared to Motorola or Summer Infant.  However, it does do the job (just badly), and it has a bundle of nice features (temperature monitoring, lullabies (that my son hates), zoom (but NOT pan! and the zoom just pixellates the already terrible picture quality), and multiple camera support.  VTech seemed to try really hard to throw a lot into this for a low price, but forgot the two most important features: sound quality/reliability and picture quality.Sadly, one and a half thumbs down.EDIT: June, 2013 - Well, my dissatisfaction turned quickly into disgust.  Other reviewers have lamented the nonexistent customer service at Vtech: HEED THEM.  Our second wasn't born until April, and has been in our room, so we haven't really needed to USE this system until very recently.  We had set it up and ensured the camera angles were appropriate prior to her birth, but hadn't used the system.  Even so, somehow, this camera inexplicably broke.  The transformer (the box-part of the plug) has evidently blown: instead of having subpar video and audio, it now has ZERO video and audio.  The parent unit doesn't read the camera at all, instead eternally waiting for connection.  And the camera unit makes a loud popping noise from the camera itself every three seconds if it is powered on.  It cannot be powered off anymore without unplugging it -- the power button now only works one way: to turn on.  So, to recap: with LESS THAN A DAY OF USE, the camera unit does not transmit video, does not transmit audio, does not turn off, and makes loud noises.  In other words, this is worse than zero stars.  This is negative stars.  They should be paying US for housing these annoying products.BUT IT GETS BETTER (read: worse).  I contacted VTech, stumbled through their ridiculous online contact template (that doesn't seem to even anticipate receiving product failure communications) and filed my concern, asking for a refund, a replacement, an extra part (the camera itself doesn't need replacing, only the power cord...with a new power cord it would be back to functioning as a less than mediocre piece of 1990s video equipment, but it would at least WORK).  VTech's website assured me I would be contacted within two days.That was almost four weeks ago.  That's right.  Four weeks of radio silence.  I'm about to contact them for the THIRD time, but this company goes beyond all other bad reviews I've ever read, ever.  It's not that they refuse to accept responsibility, don't warrant the product, charge the customer shipping.  They might do all those things.  But who knows?  The company seems to collectively hide under the table whenever the phone rings, and, without being able to reach them, the consumer is completely up a creek.I've written many reviews.  I've NEVER had to write one like this.Buyer beware.",1,This is my second video monitoring system the first being a Summer Infant Day and Night that we purchased in 2010 when our first child was born

2931,-31.607520181863148,Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"We have not had ANY luck with Fisher-Price products.  When this P.O.S. worked for about 6 short weeks though, it was a good product.  Ours broke without warning, and now the aquarium part does not work at all. We get music, sound effects, and the blinking lights, but no bubbles and fish/starfish movement.  It really sucks to see (and hear) the dissapointment on our baby's face as the aquarium suddenly stopped working!  Also, our other bouncer, a Fisher-Price 'Flutter & Chime' bouncer, has this plastic bird that vibrates excessively and makes a loud, annoying noise.  It is not affixed properly to the product to begin with.  We also were dissapointed in the Fisher-Price 'Aquarium Cradle Swing', since the swing goes much too fast, even on the slowest setting.  All in all, 3 different products by Fisher-Price, and all fell short in expectations and useability.  Bottom line- look elsewhere for a better quality bouncer.  Clearly, Fisher-Price quality is not too good on many of their seemingly shoddy products.UPDATE: 1/2/2006 After taking this thing apart, and fixing the loose connections inside, I have been using this the past few weeks, and yesterday, my 13 pound, 4.5 month old daughter managed to thrust her head over the side of this bouncer, and she hit the floor!  Despite tightening the straps to the correct length!  Folks, even if you are there supervising your infant, they can thrust themselves off the sides and get hurt.  All it takes is a second.  This is a FLAWED and DANGEROUS product!  There should be some sort of side-guards or higher side bolsters in order to keep infants from falling off the side.  I was lucky in this case, since my infant apparently did not get hurt.  I am throwing this product out immediately, and destroying it so nobody else gets their hands on it.  It's that potentially dangerous!  Just read every other review here.  So many others have mentioned the same shortcoming.

17039,-33.78024570693591,"The First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor, 2 Parent Unit","Note: we never installed batteries in these units, preferring to plug them all into AC sockets. So none of this has anything to do with low batteries!!We bought this unit from Amazon in late January 2011, paying $63.54. The video review and other reviews here and elsewhere led me to believe that it might be a little quirky when dealing with distances or interference, but it sounded like it would suit us well, with the 2 remote units and ability to speak from remote to either the other remote, or to both remote and base. I really tried to like this, despite my wife's initial reservations (due to low volume even at the max setting). In the end (after less than one year!), it has been worse than I could have imagined.Our setup was odd but effective for us, as we used it with another older analog monitor (great and loud at short distance, but way too much interference for a remote in the basement 2 floors down), as follows... Other monitor's base is near the crib, with its remote at our bedside... The P400 base unit was placed directly in front of the analog remote, so it would directly relay that very loud & clear audio from the crib area to one P400 remote on the main floor (1 floor directly below P400 base), and the other P400 remote in the basement (2 floors down, maybe 10' to the side). This largely overcame the too-quiet performance of the P400, which otherwise left me craning to hear what was going on when we tried it with the P400 base by the crib.This worked pretty well, though I found I would have to turn the P400 remotes off and back on periodically to restore relatively good performance (it would degrade over time, such that it got harder and harder to hear well, even when the lights indicated it was receiving loud signals, with the bars filling up!). Every once in a while it seemed to have lost the connection altogether, but wasn't giving the beep signaling disconnection (VERY frustrating!).After some months, the basement unit would more and more frequently work poorly, or not at all. My wife would get very frustrated when she would call me repeatedly and I couldn't hear a thing of it! I initially chalked it up to interference (thought nothing had changed!), and resolved to power cycle both remotes much more frequently. But alas, over time it pretty much just stopped working completely (but again, with the volume lights indicating it was receiving audio from the base station!), leaving me scrambling to resurrect another old monitor temporarily (suffering with it's droning interference) when working in the basement.We made do with that suboptimal situation for some time, but now I find the main level P400 remote (just a floor directly below the P400 base!) also stopped working... and again, the lights would be busily indicating incoming audio all the while!!Here is the kicker..... In desperation, I actually tried plugging earphones into the remote's jack, and Lo & Behold, it WORKED (via the headphones), with the activity shown by the lights now audible once again!!  Unplug the headphones and the remote would again go silent, despite audio lights still indicating activity. Plug in the headphones and I could again hear it! I tested both remotes and the base unit, and found that the broadcast function from remotes to base was working just fine, but there was nothing coming from the remote speakers no matter what I did. These suckers are effectively dead as monitors, since I have no intention of using them with headphones!!I conclude that there is something major wrong with the audio system on these units, something that prevents the received signals (again, as indicated by the activity lights that are a-flicker on the remotes) from making it to the built-in speaker... Which of course renders the units completely useless, or worse since there's no error signal to let you know something has gone horribly wrong!I did take one of the remotes apart (5 screws in total, 3 of them very small), and couldn't see anything clearly wrong with the wiring/connections, no bursting capacitors, etc., so I have no idea if this is a problem at the gross level or something amiss in the circuit board, or what... But for what it is worth, I would not touch these units.FWIW, when new, they did work reasonably well, though I fault them for unusually low volume even when set to loudest setting. And then there's the stealth degradation over time issue, which may be temporarily remedied by power-cycling the remotes... But in the end, if your experience is anything like ours, the remotes' speakers will eventually cease to produce any audio at all......Don't be seduced by the nice features. It won't last, at least in our experience....",1,Note we never installed batteries in these units preferring to plug them all into AC sockets So none of this has anything to do with low batteriesWe bought this unit from Amazon in late January 2011 paying 6354 The video review and other reviews here and elsewhere led me to believe that it might be a little quirky when dealing with distances or interference but it sounded like it would suit us well with the 2 remote units and ability to speak from remote to either the other remote or to both remote and base I really tried to like this despite my wifes initial reservations due to low volume even at the max setting In the end after less than one year it has been worse than I could have imaginedOur setup was odd but effective for us as we used it with another older analog monitor great and loud at short distance but way too much interference for a remote in the basement 2 floors down as follows Other monitors base is near the crib with its remote at our bedside The P400 base unit was placed directly in front of the analog remote so it would directly relay that very loud  clear audio from the crib area to one P400 remote on the main floor 1 floor directly below P400 base and the other P400 remote in the basement 2 floors down maybe 10 to the side This largely overcame the tooquiet performance of the P400 which otherwise left me craning to hear what was going on when we tried it with the P400 base by the cribThis worked pretty well though I found I would have to turn the P400 remotes off and back on periodically to restore relatively good performance it would degrade over time such that it got harder and harder to hear well even when the lights indicated it was receiving loud signals with the bars filling up Every once in a while it seemed to have lost the connection altogether but wasnt giving the beep signaling disconnection VERY frustratingAfter some months the basement unit would more and more frequently work poorly or not at all My wife would get very frustrated when she would call me repeatedly and I couldnt hear a thing of it I initially chalked it up to interference thought nothing had changed and resolved to power cycle both remotes much more frequently But alas over time it pretty much just stopped working completely but again with the volume lights indicating it was receiving audio from the base station leaving me scrambling to resurrect another old monitor temporarily suffering with its droning interference when working in the basementWe made do with that suboptimal situation for some time but now I find the main level P400 remote just a floor directly below the P400 base also stopped working and again the lights would be busily indicating incoming audio all the whileHere is the kicker In desperation I actually tried plugging earphones into the remotes jack and Lo  Behold it WORKED via the headphones with the activity shown by the lights now audible once again  Unplug the headphones and the remote would again go silent despite audio lights still indicating activity Plug in the headphones and I could again hear it I tested both remotes and the base unit and found that the broadcast function from remotes to base was working just fine but there was nothing coming from the remote speakers no matter what I did These suckers are effectively dead as monitors since I have no intention of using them with headphonesI conclude that there is something major wrong with the audio system on these units something that prevents the received signals again as indicated by the activity lights that are aflicker on the remotes from making it to the builtin speaker Which of course renders the units completely useless or worse since theres no error signal to let you know something has gone horribly wrongI did take one of the remotes apart 5 screws in total 3 of them very small and couldnt see anything clearly wrong with the wiringconnections no bursting capacitors etc so I have no idea if this is a problem at the gross level or something amiss in the circuit board or what But for what it is worth I would not touch these unitsFWIW when new they did work reasonably well though I fault them for unusually low volume even when set to loudest setting And then theres the stealth degradation over time issue which may be temporarily remedied by powercycling the remotes But in the end if your experience is anything like ours the remotes speakers will eventually cease to produce any audio at allDont be seduced by the nice features It wont last at least in our experience,-1
