20952,71.34049581915484,Joovy Scooter Single Stroller Greenie,"***I've posted an UPDATE at the end***First, let me state that I have been buying products from Amazon for the past 12 years.  I love Amazon.  I love the reviews because they have always played a part (sometimes more, sometimes less) in the products I decide to purchase.  For some reason, I have never left a review (I know!!).  Until now.  I feel such an urge to express how much my husband and I love this stroller.My first son will turn 7 next month.  We purchased an Evenflo stroller/car seat travel system for him in 2005.  We hated it.  We used the car seat, but never EVER used the stroller.  It was big, bulky, heavy, and a pain in the rear.  I think my husband hated it even more than I did.  I wore my first son everywhere instead of putting him in a stroller.  Fast forward to 6 years later, and we have our second son in September of 2011.  I researched for months.  I wanted to find a stroller that had several qualities:*  Looks - As shallow as it may seem, I wanted a stroller that wasn't ugly.  I wasn't interested in any fancy or cutesy designs on the fabric.  I wanted simple and sleek.  I wanted something that my husband would not mind pushing around, either.*  Weight - I wanted something that was not super heavy.*  Quality/Durability - I was looking for something that would hold up through months and months of theme park visits, and ultimately, through daily runs.*  Ease - Meaning that I wanted it to fold easily, and be a stroller that I could easily put in and out of my car without looking like my back was going to give out and I would collapse ;-)*  Price - I wanted something under $100.  I find that the more expensive a stroller is, the sleeker it looks (a shame that more less expensive strollers aren't more attractive).  I wanted the look, and the quality, for under $100.*  Able to use with a Graco car seat - I knew I did not really want to purchase another combo travel system of any kind, really.*  Canopy - Needed a bigger one to protect from the FL sun.So with these key things in mind, I researched for hours upon hours for the last couple months of my pregnancy.  I still held off.  I wanted to make the right purchase and not settle for another crap stroller that would be a huge disappointment.  When my son was a month old, I pulled the trigger and purchased the Joovy Scooter Stroller in Greenie.  BEST DECISION EVER.  We live in Florida.  Below the freeze line in FL - an hour south of Tampa on the water.  Here is my take on the Pro's and Con's of the Joovy.  I hope it might help out someone else who is on the fence...PRO's:1)  Cost.  $99.99.  True, it was just one penny shy of my limit I set.  But it was under.  I had a giftcard from a family member, so the stroller really only cost me $49.99.  A steal!2)  Assembly.  This was almost totally assembled when I received it.  It has been about 8 months since I purchased this, so my memory may fail me on the exact details of the assembly...but I seem to remember only installing the brake bar and the wheels (others may recall more, but the fact is, that it was super easy overall, and I did not need to wait for the assistance of my husband).  I noticed right away that I was lacking the right size hub cap for one of the back wheels.  This is only a cosmetic feature.  It does not in any way mess with how the stroller would function, but still I felt that I should call the Joovy customer service to inquire.  I don't remember waiting at all on hold.  The lady I spoke to was super friendly, and practically no questions asked, she Fed Ex'ed me a couple of hub caps for free.  I got them in a couple of days.3)  Ease.  It does take both hands to fold the stroller up, but it is super easy after getting the hang of it.  It only took me a couple of tries before I became a pro.  No struggling in parking lots, looking like the stressed out parent that wants to pull an Office Space on the stroller with a bat.  There was an Up All Night episode that dealt with beating a stroller to pieces in a parking lot.  I think all of us as parents have been there at one point or another, with some piece of baby equipment.  It unfolds so easily, it's ridiculous!  I love it.  You just pull the handles up and that's that.4)  Maneuverability.  Some people had mentioned that they wish the wheels weren't plastic.  It is true that they are indeed plastic.  But I have never had a problem with them.  My stroller feels like it's gliding on ice, for the most part.  Only a couple of times have the wheels gotten stuck/tangled/whatever.  I would not even consider this an issue, but felt it was worth a mention, at least. Seriously, in 8 months, it may have happened twice.  That's it. And this stroller has had a LOT of mileage.5)  The handles.  There seems to be a discussion about the handles being rough.  My husband nor I have EVER had an issue with this!  The handles are great.  We live 1 hour and 15 minutes away from Disney World and had annual passes.  We went at least two weekends a month, spending 12 hours a day at the parks.  We just purchased annual passes to Universal recently, and spend just as much time there.  We have never received a blister from the handles, and never felt that they were rough.  They have a nice, secure grip making it easy to maneuver through crowds and one-handed (love the design of the handles).  I am not exaggerating when I say we spend 12 hour days at the parks.  The stroller makes it such a breeze.  I also wear my baby some in the Ergo Performance in Spring Green (also purchased off Amazon, the green color is a pretty close match to this stroller for anyone wondering), but he really loves this stroller.  I also run at the park 5 or 6 times a week with this stroller.  No, it is not listed as a jogging stroller, but it works perfectly for me.  I run anywhere from 1-4 miles at a time, each day, and have never had an issue.  I run mostly with only one hand on the handles, and it turns beautifully as I run.6)  Durability.  What can I say?  I think I've already said it all.  This stroller has held up wonderfully throughout all of our theme park adventures and through each of my morning runs at the park.  I have no complaints.7)  Looks.  I have to say, this stroller is beautiful!  I adore it.  It is sleek, modern, slim, but durable.  The Greenie color is GORGEOUS (it's my favorite color)!!! And I can find it easily at the theme parks.8)  Basket.  There is PLENTY of storage underneath in the oversized basket.  We can fit a big diaper bag, blankets, toys, a purse, and more.9)  Reclining.  The seat reclines very easily.  If you recline it as far back as it will go, it makes changing diapers easy.  When my son is awake and wants to look around, I put him in the high back seating position.  If he wants to sleep, I just recline.  Not much to it.  Pretty simple and easy.10) Car Seat.  I had no problems at all attaching our Graco car seat to this stroller when my son was younger (no car seat adapter needed).  We don't need to do this anymore, but it worked great when we did.11) Weight.  It is still a little heavy, but honestly, I have no problem lifting it in and out of my Element or my husband's Accord.  It folds up nicely and lies pretty flat.  I'm 5'5"" and 115 lbs.  I have no problem lifting this.  It's hard to explain without you seeing it in person, but the stroller is pretty slim.  It is not bulky like most.12)  Foot brakes.  I have never had a problem with my feet hitting the brakes (even on all my runs).  Neither has my husband (he is 6' tall).  The brake works great, as it should.13)  Foot Rest.  This is a cool feature for the little one.14)  The CANOPY!  The canopy on this is AMAZING.  It is super large.  I love it.  Like I've already mentioned, we are in the FL heat all year long.  This canopy is awesome at keeping my little guy protected from too much sun.  I also like the clear window I can look through at him (which I like to do when I am running to see if he fell asleep or not ;).15) Extra pockets.  There are side pockets for your little one to store extra toys, or as I do, I put his bottles there and take them out as he needs them.  There is also a large zippered pocket on the back of the stroller.16)  Cup Holder.  I rarely use the cup holder as a cup holder.  I usually use it to hold my phone as I run, but it does have a cup holder.17)  The fabric.  Love it.  It has not faded, even in the FL sun.  It is comfortable for my son, and easy for me to wipe up, or to shake the sand off as we have lots of beach visits.  While I wouldn't consider this the best stroller to push through sand, we have done it.  We live where the beaches are super soft sand, so you have to ""pop a wheelie"" with the front wheels being totally air borne to push it through, but we have done it several times.  Also, the rain seems to roll right off the fabric, mostly.  The fabric comes off for washing, too.18) Extras.  My son LOVES propping his foot up on the bar as we stroll (while I'm walking or running with him).  Also, we love the super padded cushions on the buckles for his chest.  And this buckles in such a way that would be harder for a toddler to figure out, I would think (but super easy for parents!).CON's:I don't have any!  The only con is not buying this. You can't beat the quality for the money here.This is my favorite stroller I have ever used!  My husband agrees.  It is so easy to push along, on flat or bumpy surfaces.  I recommend this to all of my friends that are having babies.  This was my very best purchase this time around.  We have been so happy with it, and our 9 month old son also seems to enjoy it!UPDATE 9/14/12:  I'm now successfully running over 6 miles at a time with my baby (almost 1 year old) boy in this stroller. I run a minimum of 3 miles/day, 5 days a week, but I have one longer run each week also. I love it!  The wheels have had a LOT of mileage on them, and they have held up quite well so far (at some point I might have to replace them as I am constantly upping my mileage).  So far in the 14 days in September I have run over 42 miles, and walked over 25 miles, while pushing this Joovy.  I don't understand the ""rough handles"" comments at all.  I've never ever had a blister or any complaints about the handles.  They work out so well for me when I run because they give me great control (mostly I run with only one hand on the handles).  Also, I get so many compliments on the looks of this stroller.",5.0,Ive posted an UPDATE at the endFirst let me state that I have been buying products from Amazon for the past 12 years  I love Amazon

22392,57.55397528976942,"Zooper 2011 Waltz Standard Stroller, Flax Brown","I did a TON of research before I purchased this stroller, and I still watch stroller reviews all the time (Babygizmo.com has really great reviews on so many strollers.) And Zooper Waltz 2011 is THE BEST of all I've seen so far.Let me tell you first though that it is not an all-terrain or jogging stroller, and it does not have an ability to be used for more than one child. So if you're looking for these things, this is not it. But if you're looking for a single stroller for city walking and a little bit of park and dirt, etc., and you don't want a monster stroller (size and weight wise), this is the best stroller of that kind.One of my favorite things about this stroller is that it comes with SO many accessories that are sold separately on most other strollers, especially those expensive ones. With this one, you pay $300 (I paid $250 for it on eBay) and get the following accessories all included:- A UV net.It easily snaps onto the canopy to completely shade the front and there are two elastic loops at the bottom to attach it securely to the stroller. It comes in a zippered pouch, and what's genius about it is that the pouch itself is actually part of the net, so you don't have to worry about ever losing the pouch!- A foot muff for cold weather.It also easily snaps onto the seat. This is something you don't see included with a stroller very often.- A removable cup holder.It can actually hold a travel mug, Starbucks cup, etc., and not just a water bottle.- A snack tray for the child.Large enough to be actually practical. Has a large, deep cup holder that securely holds any sippy cup, a bowl-like section to put some snacks, and two compartments in the middle.- A baby bumper bar.You can either completely remove it or just swing it away to make it easier to get your child in and out of the stroller.- Infant car seat adapter straps.You attach it to the D-rings on the sides of the seat, then it goes over your infant car seat and you secure it with a buckle and by tightening the strap. It's not one of those big, bulky frame adapters that some strollers have for infant car seat. To me, that's just one more thing to find a place for when you're not using it as a travel system. This strap system feels very very secure, and it's just much more travel friendly.- A rain cover.The 2011 model does not come with a rain cover, but that's because the improved canopy (which is gigantic and full-coverage) is made of complete water-proof fabric and acts as a rain cover. I love this because I don't have to worry about forgetting the rain cover at home or fiddling with it trying to put it on when it starts raining unexpectedly on the go.So, only $300 with all these amazing, practical accessories is absolutely the best price for its value.Now on to the stroller features. (That's right, I haven't even started on the main stroller yet!)- Light-weightIt's just under 19lbs. I'm petite and don't have a lot of arm muscle, but I don't have any problem getting this in and out of my trunk or carrying it up a couple flights of stairs every once in a while.- High weight capacity of 55lbs.Not that I would use it for a 55lbs child regularly, but it means it's that sturdy.- Easy to assemble.It comes in a big box and all you have to do is snap on the wheels and the canopy. Super easy. Took us 5 minutes. However, I do want to note that we attached the canopy wrong at first, and because of that, it ripped at the zipper when we tried to recline the seat. There are four snaps on the bottom of the canopy, one set at the very front on each side and another in the middle. The front set snaps onto the sides of the seat, and the middle ones onto the back of the seat. Our mistake was attaching the front ones to the seat back. But Zooper had a super nice warranty service, where they sent us a brand new canopy for no charge, even though it was our fault.- Newborn friendly.It has a very flat recline position, and the leg rest goes all the way up and securely zips on to the sides of the seat, creating a bassinet-like environment. (The leg rest also lays flat for babies or goes down for older kids.) It also has an infant guard at the top of the seat that would prevent your infant from ever sliding out of the seat when the seat is fully reclined and the back of the canopy is removed. But this piece can be tucked away with an attached velcro once your child gets taller. It also comes with an infant head rest that is attached to the shoulder straps, but this is also removable.- One-handed open and fold, and stands on its own when folded.Now there's a trick to doing it one-handed. It's supposed to be done with two hands, and it's super easy to do, but you can also do it one-handed. To open it, you unlock the lock on the side, push the big button on the handle bar, and instead of grabbing the small handle on the side like you would when you're opening it with two hands, you just push down on the top bar of the basket with your foot. To fold it, first you retract the canopy and put the seat up to the upright position, lock all the wheels, and then push the big button on the handlebar, lift up on the small handle on the side with your knee (just a little nudge), and then you push the whole stroller down towards the ground with the handlebar. That allows the frame to slide into a folded position. Then, I usually have to push down on the front of the frame with my foot to engage the lock. It might sound complicated, but once you get the hang of it, you can do it in seconds. My baby's been real clingy and so it's been nice being able  to open and fold the stroller while holding him.- Full-coverage canopy with a large viewing window.This canopy is probably my favorite feature of this stroller. First of all, it's huge and it folds all the way down to the bumper bar to completely shade and cover your child. It has a large viewing window with a flap to cover it when not in use. The flap has no noisy velcro on it, so you won't have to worry about waking up your baby. When the seat is fully reclined but you still want full-coverage on your sleeping baby, you can actually unzip whole another full-sized panel to do that. Also, there's another zipper on the canopy that you can unzip and reveal a mesh underneath the back of the canopy. This enables a good air-flow through the back into your child. The whole back of the canopy and the mesh underneath it are both completely removable as well.- Great storage.The basket is huge and can fit my diaper bag, another big bag with beach towels and blankets, jackets, water bottles, and lunch fairly easily. So it's perfect for picnics and shopping. It has a hard bottom so that you will never be dragging your stuff on the ground. An amazing feature of this basket is that they put a vertical zipper on each side of the basket towards the front of the stroller that goes all the way to the bottom, so you will have a complete access to the content even when the seat is fully reclined. I love it! I also like that the side fabric of the basket is kind of see-through so you can see where everything is.Also, there is a large pocket on the back of the canopy where I can fit my clutch-size purse, and another pocket on top of it with a lid, which is perfect for keeping your keys, cell-phones, etc. There's another small pocket on the back of the seat, where the warnings are supposed to go, but that's where I keep my UV net and car seat adapters.- One-handed bar recline that has 4 different positions.I can even adjust the recline up and down while walking with this stroller.- Seat fabric machine-washable!The seat fabric comes off to be machine-washed. (Canopy is spot clean only.)- Excellent maneuverability.It pushes really well and as long as I'm on a paved street, I can totally push it and even turn it one-handed with the baby and tons of stuff in the basket. It does pretty good on grass, dirt and gravel but I usually need two hands to turn on rough terrain.- Carrying handle on the side and the ability to wheel behind when it's folded.Carrying handle is definitely nice when I lift it up to put it in my trunk, and if you have the front wheels locked, you can wheel it behind you like a luggage!- Front swivel wheels that can also be locked straight for rougher terrain, and one-touch rear brake.This is pretty standard for most strollers but it's definitely a nice feature.- All four wheels have suspension system.I've taken it on grass and some dirt roads, and it pushed very well!- Padded five point harness that are height adjustable.This is pretty standard too and you do have to rethread the shoulder straps to adjust the height, but you won't be adjusting them all the time so this is not an issue. The paddings on the shoulder straps are easily removable. The buckle is easy to do, no puzzle pieces. You can also detach the shoulder straps and use it as a 3 point harness once your child is old enough.As you can tell, I just cannot say enough good things about this stroller!! I've been using it for almost 7 months since my son was a newborn and I absolutely love it!Zooper also has Bolero and Twist, and the differences are:-Bolero is $400 and comes with a bassinet kit to make the seat a real bassinet. It's a tad bigger and heavier, but has a more compact standing fold than Waltz.-Twist is $200 and has an umbrella fold. It can not stand on its own when folded but everything else is the same as Waltz.",5.0,I did a TON of research before I purchased this stroller and I still watch stroller reviews all the time

assembleIt comes in a big box and all you have to do is snap on the wheels and the canopy Super easy Took us 5 minutes However I do want to note that we attached the canopy wrong at first and because of that it ripped at the zipper when we tried to recline the seat There are four snaps on the bottom of the canopy one set at the very front on each side and another in the middle The front set snaps onto the sides of the seat and the middle ones onto the back of the seat Our mistake was attaching the front ones to the seat back But Zooper had a super nice warranty service where they sent us a brand new canopy for no charge even though it was our fault Newborn friendlyIt has a very flat recline position and the leg rest goes all the way up and securely zips on to the sides of the seat creating a bassinetlike environment The leg rest also lays flat for babies or goes down for older kids It also has an infant guard at the top of the seat that would prevent your infant from ever sliding out of the seat when the seat is fully reclined and the back of the canopy is removed But this piece can be tucked away with an attached velcro once your child gets taller It also comes with an infant head rest that is attached to the shoulder straps but this is also removable Onehanded open and fold and stands on its own when foldedNow theres a trick to doing it onehanded Its supposed to be done with two hands and its super easy to do but you can also do it onehanded To open it you unlock the lock on the side push the big button on the handle bar and instead of grabbing the small handle on the side like you would when youre opening it with two hands you just push down on the top bar of the basket with your foot To fold it first you retract the canopy and put the seat up to the upright position lock all the wheels and then push the big button on the handlebar lift up on the small handle on the side with your knee just a little nudge and then you push the whole stroller down towards the ground with the handlebar That allows the frame to slide into a folded position Then I usually have to push down on the front of the frame with my foot to engage the lock It might sound complicated but once you get the hang of it you can do it in seconds My babys been real clingy and so its been nice being able  to open and fold the stroller while holding him Fullcoverage canopy with a large viewing windowThis canopy is probably my favorite feature of this stroller First of all its huge and it folds all the way down to the bumper bar to completely shade and cover your child It has a large viewing window with a flap to cover it when not in use The flap has no noisy velcro on it so you wont have to worry about waking up your baby When the seat is fully reclined but you still want fullcoverage on your sleeping baby you can actually unzip whole another fullsized panel to do that Also theres another zipper on the canopy that you can unzip and reveal a mesh underneath the back of the canopy This enables a good airflow through the back into your child The whole back of the canopy and the mesh underneath it are both completely removable as well Great storageThe basket is huge and can fit my diaper bag another big bag with beach towels and blankets jackets water bottles and lunch fairly easily So its perfect for picnics and shopping It has a hard bottom so that you will never be dragging your stuff on the ground An amazing feature of this basket is that they put a vertical zipper on each side of the basket towards the front of the stroller that goes all the way to the bottom so you will have a complete access to the content even when the seat is fully reclined I love it I also like that the side fabric of the basket is kind of seethrough so you can see where everything isAlso there is a large pocket on the back of the canopy where I can fit my clutchsize purse and another pocket on top of it with a lid which is perfect for keeping your keys cellphones etc Theres another small pocket on the back of the seat where the warnings are supposed to go but thats where I keep my UV net and car seat adapters Onehanded bar recline that has 4 different positionsI can even adjust the recline up and down while walking with this stroller Seat fabric machinewashableThe seat fabric comes off to be machinewashed Canopy is spot clean only Excellent maneuverabilityIt pushes really well and as long as Im on a paved street I can totally push it and even turn it onehanded with the baby and tons of stuff in the basket It does pretty good on grass dirt and gravel but I usually need two hands to turn on rough terrain Carrying handle on the side and the ability to wheel behind when its foldedCarrying handle is definitely nice when I lift it up to put it in my trunk and if you have the front wheels locked you can wheel it behind you like a luggage Front swivel wheels that can also be locked straight for rougher terrain and onetouch rear brakeThis is pretty standard for most strollers but its definitely a nice feature All four wheels have suspension systemIve taken it on grass and some dirt roads and it pushed very well Padded five point harness that are height adjustableThis is pretty standard too and you do have to rethread the shoulder straps to adjust the height but you wont be adjusting them all the time so this is not an issue The paddings on the shoulder straps are easily removable The buckle is easy to do no puzzle pieces You can also detach the shoulder straps and use it as a 3 point harness once your child is old enoughAs you can tell I just cannot say enough good things about this stroller Ive been using it for almost 7 months since my son was a newborn and I absolutely love itZooper also has Bolero and Twist and the differences areBolero is 400 and comes with a bassinet kit to make the seat a real bassinet Its a tad bigger and heavier but has a more compact standing fold than WaltzTwist is 200 and has an umbrella fold It can not stand on its own when folded but everything else is the same as Waltz,1.0
28615,53.675192943603,Ubbi Cloth Diaper Pail Liner,"(updated 3.22.13) After extensive research, trial and error, and even a class on cloth diapering at the local birth center, I settled on the Grovia system and have not regretted that decision. My son is now 22 months and we have been using Grovia since about 8 weeks. We have lots of cloth diapering friends so I have had the chance to see lots of cloth diapers in action and I am very glad that I invested in grovia to begin with. Here are the products we use, why we like them and (in some cases) how they could be improved. There is a lot of material covered in this review. I am doing it this way because I wish there had been something comprehensive like this on Amazon when I was shopping for my diaper stuff! If you are considering buying a Grovia system, this will be helpful for you. If you are looking for a comprehensive review on just one item, other reviews may be more suitable.Our total system consists of the following:Essentials;*17 Hybrid shells in a variety of prints and solids = 6 velcro and 11 snapGroVia Hybrid Snap Shell Diaper, Cloud, One Size*36 Organic Grovia InsertsGroVia Certified Organic Cotton Soaker Pad 2 Pack*Magic Stick diaper ointmentMagic Stick All Natural Diaper Ointment, Clear, Net Wt. 2 oz.*Brabantia Pedal BinBrabantia Pedal Bin ,30 Liter , with plastic inner bucket, White 287640*2 Ubbi diaper pail washable linersUbbi Cloth Diaper Pail Liner*36 Grovia WipesGroVia Cotton Cloth Wipes, 12 count*Diaper DetergentTiny Bubbles Detergent, Net Wt. 60 oz., Yellow BoxNon-essentials, we use these items for convenience,*Diaper scraper Make My Day Two Birds Silicone Spatula and Scraper Set, Black*Diaper sprayer bumGenius Diaper Sprayer*Wipe Warmer (perfectly fits grovia wipes) Prince Lionheart Premium Wipe Warmer*2 waterproof changing pad covers Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Ecru*24 washcloths (for top layer of changing pad)Martex Hospitality Washcloths - 24-Pack (White)*1 little pottyBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Little Potty - White*Disposable Biodegradable diapers for backup and travel Broody Chick 100% Natural Fully Compostable Diapers Jumbo Box (Junior 26.5 - 55.1 lbs.

There was quite a bit of trial and error and research that went into the above system. I have only listed the items that work beautifully and will simplify your cloth diapering efforts.I will jump right in with some gripes.Cloth diapering is not cheap and despite industry claims, I have not realized cost savings in the first year (as compared to buying premium disposable diapers at Costco). When you add up the cost of the diapers and accessories, the cost of your time doing all those extra loads of laundry (or paying a diaper service), the cost of the resources to wash and dry all those loads, and the cost of all the special ""cloth friendly"" accoutrements necessary to care for the diapers without ruining them, it really adds up. If you are going to use the system for more than once child, then you will realize some significant savings (be sure to buy gender-neutral covers if that is your intention). The bigger motivation to cloth diaper (at least for me) is the dramatically reduced environmental impact and health benefits of cloth diapering. Conventional disposable diapers are loaded with toxins that pollute the earth, the workers that produce them and of course, your baby. Not to mention that it takes over 500 years for regular disposables to break down in the environment. That means that your babies dirty diapers will still be polluting the earth when your great, great, great, great grandchildren are born. Talk about a crappy legacy to leave behind!Now the good stuff.I chose Grovia because of the convenience and simplicity of the whole system. I knew that if I was going to cloth diaper, it would need to be as simple and easy as possible, even if that meant I would pay a bit more up front. There is a massive amount of information about cloth diapering on the net and much of it is overly complicated. Cloth diapering does not have to be complicated. You can simplify things quite a bit by sticking with one brand/ one system.Having said that, the grovia system was too big, hard and bulky for our 10 pound newborn (and Grovia products are pretty trim compared to most cloth diapering systems) so we ended up using disposables for the first couple of months. It would look like he was sleeping on an incline because the grovia insert was so thick under his bum. Other cloth brands have special newborn sized diapers and inserts, but I chose not to invest the money for newborn cloth diapers that would only be used for a short time. We used Broody Chick 100% compostable disposable diapers for that period and the added convenience of the disposables was great during that initial difficult phase. We had some minor problems with diaper rash during that time, but the Triple Paste always cleared it up in a day (then we would go back to the Grovia Magic Stick).I breastfeed our baby so the diaper changes are more frequent (than formula fed babies). I wanted enough diapers to last three days. I did not want to do an extra load of laundry every two days. I kept adding covers, inserts and wipes until I had enough to last three days, hence the numbers above. If I had known in the beginning how many covers and inserts were going to be required, I would have saved some money by buying some of the larger Grovia combo deals.The 30 liter Brabantia garbage pail is all steel, easy to clean and self sealing (no stink outside the pail) and the perfect size for three days worth of Grovia wipes, covers, inserts and changing pads. It has an inner plastic pail with handle that makes trips to the laundry room a breeze. The Ubbi cloth pail liners are the only ones that fit the Brabantia pail snugly and I turn them inside out and wash them right along with the diapers. I have two so they can be rotated. For anyone wondering, the dimensions on the Ubbi cloth pail liner are 33x17 (and are NOT the size of a typical ""tall"" kitchen garbage bag).I primarily used the 6 velcro covers (more convenient than snaps) through 11 months when our baby was finally able to figure out how to open them (and they are pretty worn looking velcro tabs at this point). Then I transitioned into primarily using the 9 snap covers and keeping the velcro covers only as backup. Grovia has a service that will remove the velcro tabs and replace with snaps for $5 a diaper. I wish they would offer a service to just replace the worn looking velcro, but I am happy with the durability of ALL the covers. They have held up better than I expected.Our son gets a lot of time in nature. We don't worry about his clothing or diapers getting dirty if he is having a great experience. The darker colors and the patterned shells hide dirt and grass soiling better than the light solid shells. The gentle cloth diaper detergents aren't great at getting out dirt or grass stains either. If I had to do it over, I would not buy any light colored solid covers.We bought some Grovia Booster pads to try before we went to the disposable overnight diapers, but our guy would soak through the regular ""Soaker Pad"" and the Booster Pad and wake up with wet clothes and bedding. There just wasn't enough absorbency for our breast fed baby. Changing him several times a night just added to the stress of those early days so we transitioned over to the disposables for night time and have been happy with that choice ever since.The Grovia Magic Stick is truly brilliant! It is all natural, effective and does not require you to dip your fingers into diaper ointment while wrangling a diaper onto a squirming baby several times a day! It also does not adversely affect the absorbency of cloth diapers they way regular ointments do. Do not use the Triple paste (or any regular diaper ointment) with your cloth diapers. The waxes and petroleum oils in regular diaper ointments coat the cotton fibers and prevent them from absorbing liquids. We tried several top rated ""natural"" ointments for our occasional diaper rash, but Triple Paste worked where the natural ones failed. We used it sparingly whenever bumps appeared (which was pretty rare compared to our disposable diapering friends).Grovia wipes are fantastic. I wrote a separate review on these that compared the three types of wipes I bought. Grovia wipes were the best of the three and they work with the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer perfectly.The Prince Lionheart Premium Wipe Warmer is the perfect size for the Grovia wipes and will hold a stack of about 15 wipes folded in half and stacked. We load a stack of wipes and then fill the wipe warmer with water from the tap. We do not use any ""wipe solution"" and we have had very little problem with diaper rash. 95% of the world cleans their bums with water alone (no paper) and it works beautifully. We stopped using the warming function after 5 months and baby does not mind the cool wipes at all. At this point, it is basically a nice looking/ easy to sanitize box to keep the wipes moist on the counter.Little Potty. We started our son on his Little Potty when he was about three months old. Whenever he would cue that he was ""going"", we would take him to his potty to go. Now at 12 months, we take him to his potty after every meal and when he cues and he uses the potty pretty consistently. It is easier to dump and rinse the little potty contents into the toilet than it is to change and wash his diapers so we encourage him to use his little potty as much as possible. He gets lots of positive feedback and interaction when he ""makes it"" to the potty so he enjoys using it. At 12 months, he is very comfortable sitting on a potty to pee or poo. We keep the Little Potty on the bathroom counter and stand with him while he is sitting on it. I have seen lots of people start out with the Little Potty on the floor, but if you have the counter space in your bathroom, this will save your knees and back and make it easier for you to interact with your baby while on the potty. In another month or two, we will transition it to the floor for his use.Grovia Little Bubbles diaper detergent. I have used the 5 top rated diaper detergents and honestly, I can't tell a lick of difference between them. I do a prewash with 1/2 indicated amount detergent and then a full wash with extra rinse using the full amount (per detergent instructions) of detergent. The most important thing is that you use a detergent designed for cloth diapers. Regular detergents have enzymes that will deteriorate the waterproof barriers in your cloth diapers. Cloth diaper detergents also do not have the dyes and perfumes that can irritate baby skin. I am currently using Grovia detergent and it is at least as good as the other top rated diaper detergents. I can't say that it is anymore effective at removing stains than the others. My diaper inserts are stained, but they are clean, soft and have no smell whatsoever when they come out of the dryer. I have always used cloth diaper detergent and I have never had to ""strip"" them. I use 14 ounces of wool dryer balls to dry my inserts and wipes. The dryer balls shaved ten minutes off the 80 minute dry cycle required to get a load of diapers dry. It takes only 70 minutes with the added wool balls.Bum Genius Diaper Sprayer. We bought this, but after reading stories of flimsy parts and flooding disasters, we replaced the hose and a couple other flimsy parts with higher quality metal plumbing pieces and have not had any problems for the past year.Carter's Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad. This is my mid layer on the changing pad. I have three layers on my changing pad at all times. Bottom Layer; changing pad cover that came with the pad Middle layer; Carter's Keep my Dry pad Top Layer; Cotton washcloth. The washcloth gets changed about twice per day and does the heavy work in this set up. It catches all the drips, smudges and bits that accompany diaper changing. The Carters catch everything else and help keep the diaper pad cover looking fresh. It gets changed about once per week. The changing pad cover itself gets changed about once per month. This three layer set up makes it easy and fastto keep the changing pad clean and fresh. All of these layers get tossed into the cloth diaper bin and are washed right along with my cloth diapers.I will come back from time to time to update this review. I hope it was helpful for those trying to wade through all the cloth diapering info out there and find a simple, but effective set up.Thanks for reading!",5.0,updated 32213 After extensive research

18044,44.20155717730981,"Infantino Wrap and Tie Baby Carrier, Black Blueberries","I bought this carrier when my daughter was about 4 weeks old; she's now 10 weeks old.  I had a Moby that I borrowed from a friend but could never quite get to work, and my daughter hated being in it.  I also have a Bjorn Active, but she seemed pretty precarious in that when she was so little.This carrier is nearly perfect for infants.  It's not quite as easy to put on as the Bjorn, but MUCH easier than the Moby, and it gives that nice snug fit that the Moby did.  It's much lighter weight than the Bjorn, so it's easier on my back.  I have the khaki-colored version, so I haven't had any problems with it showing dirt and dust.  I wish the straps weren't so long (one size fits all), but I just wrap them around to my back and tie them again loosely.  [I'm 5'4"" and 145 lbs.]  I think this carrier would fit most people.  The fabric is thick, and the construction seems to be of good quality. It might be hot in hot weather, but most carriers are.This has been a life saver.  My daughter won't sleep anywhere except while being held.  Now, once she's fed/diapered/etc and getting fussy (i.e., needs to sleep), I pop her in and walk around and sing.  After a couple of minutes of fussing, she is sound asleep, sometimes for several hours.  I can do a little light work around the house, plus I can sit and type at the computer (she's in the wrap right now).*******Update 8/1/2010--my daughter is now almost 5 months old, and this carrier still works great with her facing me for her naps.  She now weighs about 15 lbs, and it's not bad for a couple hours of use (especially if I can sit for part of the time).  She starts to strain my back when I have to walk around with her for a couple of hours, but less so than when she is forward-facing in the Bjorn Active.I have tried the face-out option, and it works OK, but I probable prefer to face her out in the Bjorn Active (it's quicker to put on).  The Wrap and Tie is a little tall for her facing out, so I have to try to scrunch down the front, and I worry about her falling asleep and having her nose down in it.  This carrier is definitely better than the Bjorn Active for facing-in naps (more support on the back of her neck so that her head doesn't flop around while she's sleeping).  A friend is sending me her Ergo, so I will compare all three once I've tried it.********Update 8/25/2010--Once I got the Ergo, I stopped using the Wrap and Tie.  Both hold the baby snug and close to me, facing in, for sleeping.  The Ergo is super easy to put on and great for my back.  I am now an Ergo convert.In summary---1) Infantino Wrap and Tie:  Pros = Great for little ones, facing in, for sleeping.  Easier to put on than the Moby and yet keeps baby nice and snug.  Can face baby out.  Sturdy.  Cheap (cheaper than other mei tai style carriers).  Not bad on my back.  Can ball it up and shove it in the diaper bag.  Cons = harder to put on than Bjorn/Ergo, not as good as the Bjorn for facing out, not as good on the back as the Ergo.2) Baby Bjorn (I have the Bjorn Active): Pros = My baby LOVES facing out when awake, and this is hands-down the best carrier for that.  I put up with back pain to keep my baby happy.  Cons: Not as good as the Wrap and Tie or Ergo for facing in/sleeping.  Hurts my back to wear it for long (baby now ~15 lbs).  Expensive.3) Ergo: Pros = Quick and easy to put on, perfect for baby facing in/sleeping, cute little hood to put over her head to block out light while sleeping, AWESOME!!!! for my back.  Cons = Expensive, baby can't face out.  (My baby doesn't much like facing in while awake but she's getting used to it.)When I go out, I usually take both the Ergo and the Bjorn with me in the car, and then pick whichever one is appropriate for my baby at the moment.  If you have enough cash to drop on both (or better yet, can get them used or hand-me-down), get both and skip the Wrap and Tie.  If you only have enough $ for one carrier, the Wrap and Tie might work.*****final update--others have commented on the baby's face being smushed into their chest in the facing-in position.  I haven't had a problem with this, but I frequently check my baby's neck position to make sure that her chin is tilted up a bit and her nose is pointing up a bit.  It's easy to look down at her and reposition her head when appropriate.  Also, I usually have her in with the binky in her mouth, which keeps her face off my chest as well.",5.0,I bought this carrier when my daughter was about 4 weeks old shes now 10 weeks old  I had a Moby that I borrowed from a friend but could never quite get to work and my daughter hated being in it  I also have a Bjorn Active but she seemed pretty precarious in that when she was so littleThis carrier is nearly perfect for infants  Its not quite as easy to put on as the Bjorn but MUCH easier than the Moby and it gives that nice snug fit that the Moby did  Its much lighter weight than the Bjorn so its easier on my back  I have the khakicolored version so I havent had any problems with it showing dirt and dust  I wish the straps werent so long one size fits all but I just wrap them around to my back and tie them again loosely  Im 54 and 145 lbs  I think this carrier would fit most people  The fabric is thick and the construction seems to be of good quality It might be hot in hot weather but most carriers areThis has been a life saver  My daughter wont sleep anywhere except while being held  Now once shes feddiaperedetc and getting fussy ie needs to sleep I pop her in and walk around and sing  After a couple of minutes of fussing she is sound asleep sometimes for several hours  I can do a little light work around the house plus I can sit and type at the computer shes in the wrap right nowUpdate 812010my daughter is now almost 5 months old and this carrier still works great with her facing me for her naps  She now weighs about 15 lbs and its not bad for a couple hours of use especially if I can sit for part of the time  She starts to strain my back when I have to walk around with her for a couple of hours but less so than when she is forwardfacing in the Bjorn ActiveI have tried the faceout option and it works OK but I probable prefer to face her out in the Bjorn Active its quicker to put on  The Wrap and Tie is a little tall for her facing out so I have to try to scrunch down the front and I worry about her falling asleep and having her nose down in it  This carrier is definitely better than the Bjorn Active for facingin naps more support on the back of her neck so that her head doesnt flop around while shes sleeping  A friend is sending me her Ergo so I will compare all three once Ive tried itUpdate 8252010Once I got the Ergo I stopped using the Wrap and Tie  Both hold the baby snug and close to me facing in for sleeping  The Ergo is super easy to put on and great for my back  I am now an Ergo convertIn summary1 Infantino Wrap and Tie  Pros  Great for little ones facing in for sleeping  Easier to put on than the Moby and yet keeps baby nice and snug  Can face baby out  Sturdy  Cheap cheaper than other mei tai style carriers  Not bad on my back  Can ball it up and shove it in the diaper bag  Cons  harder to put on than BjornErgo not as good as the Bjorn for facing out not as good on the back as the Ergo2 Baby Bjorn I have the Bjorn Active Pros  My baby LOVES facing out when awake and this is handsdown the best carrier for that  I put up with back pain to keep my baby happy  Cons Not as good as the Wrap and Tie or Ergo for facing insleeping  Hurts my back to wear it for long baby now 15 lbs  Expensive3 Ergo Pros  Quick and easy to put on perfect for baby facing insleeping cute little hood to put over her head to block out light while sleeping AWESOME for my back  Cons  Expensive baby cant face out  My baby doesnt much like facing in while awake but shes getting used to itWhen I go out I usually take both the Ergo and the Bjorn with me in the car and then pick whichever one is appropriate for my baby at the moment  If you have enough cash to drop on both or better yet can get them used or handmedown get both and skip the Wrap and Tie  If you only have enough  for one carrier the Wrap and Tie might workfinal updateothers have commented on the babys face being smushed into their chest in the facingin position  I havent had a problem with this but I frequently check my babys neck position to make sure that her chin is tilted up a bit and her nose is pointing up a bit  Its easy to look down at her and reposition her head when appropriate  Also I usually have her in with the binky in her mouth which keeps her face off my chest as well,1.0
9166,41.352666244505336,"Joovy Zoom 360 Swivel Wheel Jogging Stroller, Blue","The joovy zoom 360 was the perfect solution for us. We couldn't justify spending the money on a mountain buggy terrain, but we wanted a very sturdy all-terrain jogger with a locking swivel wheel. I tried out a BOB as well, in the store. I also wanted a large sun canopy, and a seat that my daughter would be able to fit in for years. This stroller is affordable while still having most of the features I was looking for in a jogger. The biggest compromise for me was that I had wanted a hand brake, but honestly I probably don't need it. This stroller is so easy to push and stop that it is unnecessary.The fabric is sturdy and feels like it will really last.The foot rest is far enough away from the seat that my daughter will be able to fit comfortably in the seat for several years without outgrowing it. It is sturdy metal with drainage holes. (I didn't like the BOB's foot rest because it was made of fabric.)The locking swivel wheel is easy to lock or unlock. It doesn't shake when I jog. I use this on the woods trails and the stroller goes right over rocks, roots, and small stumps without a problem. The 16"" rear tires are great and make for a very smooth ride. The suspension is nice and springy.The canopy is AWESOME. I like that it is so strong and very adjustable. It also stands up well to the wind. The full sun coverage is one of the reasons I picked this stroller. It has two reflective strips on the front. The window is large and works great. The Velcro flap is held up with a toggle.The straps for the 5-point harness straps are adjustable; both in length and position, but the shoulder straps are wide enough that my 5-month-old tends to have one slip off a shoulder. I think it will work perfectly as she grows. They also have reflective stitching, which is nice. The buckle is simple for adults but hard for children. It would be nice to have padding and a chest strap, but I can live without it.The seat is sturdy and has lots of room for growth. I can still use this stroller for a 5 or 6 -year-old with no problem. The weight capacity is very high compared to similar jogging strollers. The seat sits up enough that a child can see out without leaning forward, yet it also reclines very easily for a newborn. When reclined, the back of the seat is mesh, which allows for good air flow. To block the sun or wind, I just hang a blanket over the back.Storage on this stroller is great. The basket on the bottom is large and can hold up to 5 pounds, it says. I put more than that in there just fine. The back of the seat has a mesh pocket that can hold up to 3 lbs. There are 2 mesh pockets on the sides in the seat for the child to use. There is also an included parent console that attaches to the handlebar with four Velcro straps. I like that it is not permanently attached and that it is included. The cup holders are neoprene and large enough and deep enough for Nalgene bottles, and the center compartment has a zippered cover. The center compartment is large enough for my phone, digital camera, and keys with room to spare.The handlebar is not adjustable, which is a bummer, but it is padded with foam and is a good height for me (5'7"") and my husband (6' 1"") and my sister (5'4"") to use comfortably. The runaway strap is attached to the bottom of the stroller, where the storage compartment is, which is great because it won't tip the stroller over if I fall down and the stroller gets away from me. The strap has Velcro to attach it to itself around the handlebar for storage.I haven't used the rain shield (because I don't tend to go jogging in the rain) but I like that I have the option. I am glad it is included.The tire pump is included and has a spot to Velcro into the basket below the seat. I had a hard time figuring out how to follow the directions to get the pump to work because the tube is stuck into the other end of the pump and I couldn't find it. It isn't screwed in, it is the brass-looking thing on the end that you can grab well enough to pull on, and then it comes right out and screws into the opposite end of the pump. It works very well and in no time my tires were ready to go. It would be nice if there was an air pressure gauge, but I can't be too picky I suppose.This stroller glides along, and can be easily pushed, turned, and stopped with one hand, even on grass or on a hill. Granted, my daughter is still very young, but I have tried it with larger children as well and have been impressed. I highly recommend this stroller.

29387,40.82258072996286,"HALO SleepSack SwaddleChange Diaper Pad Covers, Sage, Newborn","I love having a new baby in the house, and even though it has only been four years since our last baby, it is truly like starting over again. It seems that every time I go shopping for baby and that I am preparing for a new baby, there are new things out there and there is new info that I am learning about baby. I personally love finding the new products on the market, then telling others about it. Like when I have guests over or when we are out and about with Wyatt, and people ask, what is that, or how did you find that, I can tell them! Recently I was sent a product that I wish that I had with my other two, and is from a company that I adore! I was sent the new Halo SwaddleChange to review! You may be thinking to yourself now, what is a Halo SwaddleChange? Well that is what I am going to tell you about. The Halo SwaddleChange has me now convinced that this is a must have for anyone with a baby. When you have a baby, you have diapers, and with a baby, they dont exactly stay still during all diaper changes. They get fussy, and antsy and they do not really enjoy being uncovered. Now when I had Robert, I just knew that having a changing table was a must have, because I did not have one with Estrella, and with Wyatt, I just know that having a Halo SwaddleChange is the must have accessory for your changing table. I love that when I go to change Wyatt, no matter how wiggly he can get, I can easily set him up in the soft and comfortable SwaddleChange that is part of his changing table, and we can both have a easier diaper change! Wyatt loves to be swaddled, and I love not having to worry about his hands getting messy when he is squirming around while I change his diaper. To put the Halo SwaddleChange on your changing table, all you have to do is put it on the changing pad like you would for any changing pad cover, then you swaddle baby with the swaddle wrap, which soothes baby and keeps them from squirming around during a diaper change. I love that there are also slots on the sides that allow the safety belt from the changing pad to come out. I also love how soft the fabric is, so I know that not only is Wyatt being swaddled and comforted during a diaper change, but he is also laying on a soft cover, which in all makes the diaper changing so much easier for both of us!!! Another huge plus about the Halo SwaddleChange, that makes me feel better about any products I use with my kids is the fact that the SwaddleChange has been awarded the PTPA (Parent Tested Parent Approved) Seal of Approval.",5.0,I love having a new baby in the house and even though it has only been four years since our last baby it is truly like starting over again It seems that every time I go shopping for baby and that I am preparing for a new baby there are new things out there and there is new info that I am learning about baby I personally love finding the new products on the market then telling others about it Like when I have guests over or when we are out and about with Wyatt and people ask what is that or how did you find that I can tell them Recently I was sent a product that I wish that I had with my other two and is from a company that I adore I was sent the new Halo SwaddleChange to review You may be thinking to yourself now what is a Halo SwaddleChange Well that is what I am going to tell you about The Halo SwaddleChange has me now convinced that this is a must have for anyone with a baby When you have a baby you have diapers and with a baby they dont exactly stay still during all diaper changes They get fussy and antsy and they do not really enjoy being uncovered Now when I had Robert I just knew that having a changing table was a must have because I did not have one with Estrella and with Wyatt I just know that having a Halo SwaddleChange is the must have accessory for your changing table I love that when I go to change Wyatt no matter how wiggly he can get I can easily set him up in the soft and comfortable SwaddleChange that is part of his changing table and we can both have a easier diaper change Wyatt loves to be swaddled and I love not having to worry about his hands getting messy when he is squirming around while I change his diaper To put the Halo SwaddleChange on your changing table all you have to do is put it on the changing pad like you would for any changing pad cover then you swaddle baby with the swaddle wrap which soothes baby and keeps them from squirming around during a diaper change I love that there are also slots on the sides that allow the safety belt from the changing pad to come out I also love how soft the fabric is so I know that not only is Wyatt being swaddled and comforted during a diaper change but he is also laying on a soft cover which in all makes the diaper changing so much easier for both of us Another huge plus about the Halo SwaddleChange that makes me feel better about any products I use with my kids is the fact that the SwaddleChange has been awarded the PTPA Parent Tested Parent Approved Seal of Approval,1.0
26110,38.29881589712044,"GroVia Hybrid Hook/Loop Shell Diaper, Surf, One Size","Background- I've been using Grovia diapers for four years (when I bought them they were called grobaby). I have 6 shells and 12 inserts. I purchased them for my oldest daughter and used them only part time for 2.5 years until she was potty trained. She still needed pull-ups at night for a long time, so I used these until she was ready to go without. She was probably 30lbs when she stopped wearing them, and they fit well. They were stored for a year until I had my other daughter, who is now 5.5 months and exclusively CD'd. I didn't use them for either girl until about a month old, since I had tiny babies.Pros- They're (mostly) organic. When they were new they were so soft and thick. Now they're definitely worn in and not so soft anymore.-I love how easy they are to use. As a first time CDer, these were perfect. Just snap the inserts in, strap on baby. Easy for pretty much anyone. No stuffing, unstuffing, folding, etc.-I love that I'm able to reuse the shells a couple of times until they're stinky or pooped in, or too wet. Some people didn't find this to be true, but after four years of use I can confidently say it's possible, and happens often for me.-I find them easy to wash, and love that the insert and shell are separate, since I machine dry the inserts and line dry the shells, which has helped to prolong their life. Contrary to some reviews, I don't find it difficult to clean poop from shells. It just agitates out of the mesh in the washing machine.-One size. Although I didn't use these diapers for my tiny babies, they are absolutely a birth to potty training diaper. My oldest was 30+lbs when she stopped wearing them (almost four yrs old). She has always been a small kid with no chunk though, so I'm not sure how long a thicker baby could wear them for.-Designs and colours are cute, nothing obnoxious, and I like that the snaps match the shell colour. Makes all those snaps less noticeable. The snaps are very well made and strong; not one has come loose or fallen off.-Versatile. Not only can you use one shell multiple times before needing to wash it, but you can also use the shells as covers for prefolds and other diapers needing covers. I used prefolds quite a bit during my daughters' first few months (can get a more custom fit on tiny babies, and I found them to be extra soft on that delicate new skin). I didn't bother buying a bunch of sized covers for my prefolds, and used the grovia shells instead. They worked perfectly!-Great for travel/shopping etc. You can leave the house with an extra shell and a few inserts, instead of 3/4 whole diapers, since the shells can be reused. I've been out with only one shell before, and I was glad I had these. I quickly rinsed the poop out of the shell, dried under the air drier in a public bathroom, and snapped in a new insert in less than 5 minutes.-Soft shells, soft elastic on the legs, very few red marks.-Few blowouts or leaks. I've only experienced a few leaks, and I think this is mainly because some inserts were too long for the shell in its smallest setting. When the shell went up in size, the issue was fixed. Also, the aplix tabs (Velcro stuff) makes these diapers super custom and snug, great for putting a CD on a squirmy baby. (The aplix also happens to be a con)Cons- the Velcro tabs. This is probably due to the fact that they're 4 years old, but the tabs are starting to curl up and not stick so well. This only began to happen, but may have began sooner if I had CD'd exclusively the first time. I can switch them out for snaps, so I may do that eventually, since the rest of the shell is in perfect condition.-Holds stink. The inserts are still in good condition, but I've had problems with the nasty ammonia smell. They really seem to hold the stink, so stripping and a religious wash routine has been key to keep them fresh smelling. Maybe this has been my own fault, because I had no idea what I was doing in the beginning, but who knows.I sun bleach them regularly, so they still look good, but they need to be machine dried for at least 20 minutes to stay soft.-Absorbency. My biggest issue with these diapers is that they aren't absorbent enough. My kids are heavy wetters, so I've never been able to use these at night. Even with the booster. Also, when wet, the inserts ripple up or buckle and don't seem very comfortable. My baby's bum gets red marks on it if left on too long, from the ripples of the top layer of the insert. I use the bumgenius freetimes with microfiber inserts at night and have no issues. Although Id rather have a natural fabric next to my daughters bum at night, the microfiber wicks the moisture away so well and we don't have to double up.-Consistency. On the smallest size, some inserts are too long for the rise of the diaper and poke out, which can cause leakage. The inserts aren't uniform in size, which isn't a huge issue, but some are longer or wider than others which is just a bit annoying.-On the bulky side. My bumgenius freetimes are less bulky, but not by much. This doesn't bother me too much, since it makes perfect sense that a cloth diaper be bulkier than an uber trim disposable.Verdict- love them enough to buy more, but would probably get the snaps next time. I love that Velcro is easier to use, but the diapers would last much longer with snaps. I'm also curious as to how the new grovias compare to the old ones. I very much recommend these!!",4.0,Background Ive been using Grovia diapers for four years when I bought them they were called grobaby I have 6 shells and 12 inserts I purchased them for my oldest

3975,38.181778845598295,"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","Ok, I read all the reviews already posted here, as well as several on some other sites. I know there were some concerns about the seat sliding, lack of cup holders, etc., BUT I got this stroller last week and there is not a single thing I can complain about. It's totally awesome.I have a 4 1/2 yo boy and a 1 yo daughter. We had been using an older Peg Perego and my son would either stand on the running board or, if my daughter was in the facing-me position, he would sit facing me on the bar that wraps around the front of the seat area (where most strollers have a snack tray) and hold on to my push bar.It wasn't comfortable at all and with the small Peg wheels we were forever getting caught up on cracks in the sidewalk or tiny bumps going up curbs. Plus the Peg is bulky when folded and is really heavy for a single stroller. I know it's not intended to be used that way but I mention it because the contrast is part of why I am so in love with our new Joovy.My son is almost 41"" tall but only 32 lbs. I'm not concerned about the height restriction - as far as I can tell that is to prevent them from bumping their head on the push bar when they get on and off but if taller kids can duck their heads a little bit when going under then it's really a non-issue, imo.We bought it at BRU in Portland, OR (no sales tax, woo hoo! A big plus for us Canadians). They only carry the red but that's what we wanted anyway. My daughter is very comfortable in the front and I like how wide her seat is. It seems wider than some other strollers she's been in but maybe that's because the seat is not as deep as the Peg seat. I noticed that she was able to lean diagonally in it when she got tired and almost lounge a little bit. She's tall for 12 months at 32"" but still the seat back is high enough to totally support her head.My son thinks it's the coolest stroller ever and loves riding on it. While we were in Portland it rained, of course, and I love how the canopy was big enough to cover both their heads! My son seems to enjoy sitting or standing and it was no problem for him to switch while we were rolling along.This stroller is so well balanced that there is no worry of it tipping with my son standing on the foot board even when the front is empty. And the steering really is a dream! We went shopping with it and with both kids riding plus me holding a shopping bag I was actually able to turn it with one hand! I could never do that with the Peg. The wheels are bigger and don't get caught up on little things, and the turning radius is incredibly tight. We went into a very cramped toy store and didn't bump into anything.While I was at BRU buying this I also picked up a pack of Prince Lionheart stroller accessories. It's the Click N' Go set with two clips and a bunch of little holders for snacks and drinks. Yes, it's designed for round bars, and yes the Joovy uses square tubing (very attractive, btw) but there are plenty of spots where this works.I put a clip on the push bar over the foam so I can attach a drink holder for myself, and I put another one at the edge of the foam on the back hand-holds (where my son holds on). If you do this you have to put it right at the edge of the foam so the clip doesn't get in the way when you fold it up. I attach the little snack cup there and he helps himself as we ride along.As far as the seat sliding back and forth - we just haven't had any problem with this. When my son wants to stand up it's pretty convenient that he can push the seat back out of the way for himself. He couldn't do this if it were snapped in place.Somebody else mentioned that folding it up was a hassle because the tray ended up on the ground. Well... not if you fold it up towards you. All it takes is lifting up on the little locking lever on the side and then pulling up on the two finger pulls on either side of the push bar (very simple). As the stroller starts to bend just reach forward and pull the snack tray in front up towards you. This keeps the rear wheels on the ground (they automatically lock as you fold up the stroller which prevents the whole things sliding away from you - this is a great detail!) and then another little side clip locks the whole thing together. It's really, really easy. (if you're wondering, I'm only 5'5"" so you don't have to be tall to comfortably do this)Opening it up is even easier. Unlatch the locking clip (and this isn't anything you have to struggle with, it just rotates up) and the whole stroller pops open. The back wheels will still be locked so you don't have to do that before putting the kids in - again, this is really nice - and just remember to relatch that other clip at the base of the push bar. You don't even have to bend to do this, you can do it with your foot.The Lionheart accessory kit also included a few S hooks which I have used for shopping bags by putting them on my push bar. I tried them on the side hand-holds but the bags brushed against the back wheels. I think they were larger than regular grocery bags though because they were from Target. Regular grocery bags would probably work great on the side. Even with two large Target bags hanging on my push bar there was still enough room for my son to sit on his little bench seat. And as I mentioned, the steering is so great that even with all that AND a third bag in my hand, I was able to maneuver through the parking lot with no problems.Ok, I lied. Maybe there is one fault I could mention. Everyone is right when they say that the basket underneath is not very useful. I mean, I still use it but I had to ask my son to get up when I wanted to get something out of it. It's minor for me though, especially considering how wonderful the rest of it is.A double stroller wouldn't have been practical for me because of the costs, the size, and the fact that my son doesn't always want to be in or on a stroller. Besides all that, it was really fun to get as many comments as I did whenever we went out! So many people asked me about it and everyone thought it was great looking.Congratulations to Joovy, we love this stroller!!",5.0,Ok I read all the reviews already posted here as well as several on some other sites I know there were some concerns about the seat sliding lack of cup holders etc BUT I got this stroller last week and there is not a single thing I can complain about Its totally awesomeI have a 4 12 yo boy and a 1 yo daughter We had been using an older Peg Perego and my son would either stand on the running board or if my daughter was in the facingme position he would sit facing me on the bar that wraps around the front of the seat area where most strollers have a snack tray and hold on to my push barIt wasnt comfortable at all and with the small Peg wheels we were forever getting caught up on cracks in the sidewalk or tiny bumps going up curbs Plus the Peg is bulky when folded and is really heavy for a single stroller I know its not intended to be used that way but I mention it because the contrast is part of why I am so in love with our new JoovyMy son is almost 41 tall but only 32 lbs Im not concerned about the height restriction  as far as I can tell that is to prevent them from bumping their head on the push bar when they get on and off but if taller kids can duck their heads a little bit when going under then its really a nonissue imoWe bought it at BRU in Portland OR no sales tax woo hoo A big plus for us Canadians They only carry the red but thats what we wanted anyway My daughter is very comfortable in the front and I like how wide her seat is It seems wider than some other strollers shes been in but maybe thats because the seat is not as deep as the Peg seat I noticed that she was able to lean diagonally in it when she got tired and almost lounge a little bit Shes tall for 12 months at 32 but still the seat back is high enough to totally support her headMy son thinks its the coolest stroller ever and loves riding on it While we were in Portland it rained of course and I love how the canopy was big enough to cover both their heads My son seems to enjoy sitting or standing and it was no problem for him to switch while we were rolling alongThis stroller is so well balanced that there is no worry of it tipping with my son standing on the foot board even when the front is empty And the steering really is a dream We went shopping with it and with both kids riding plus me holding a shopping bag I was actually able to turn it with one hand I could never do that with the Peg The wheels are bigger and dont get caught up on little things and the turning radius is incredibly tight We went into a very cramped toy store and didnt bump into anythingWhile I was at BRU buying this I also picked up a pack of Prince Lionheart stroller accessories Its the Click N Go set with two clips and a bunch of little holders for snacks and drinks Yes its designed for round bars and yes the Joovy uses square tubing very attractive btw but there are plenty of spots where this worksI put a clip on the push bar over the foam so I can attach a drink holder for myself and I put another one at the edge of the foam on the back handholds where my son holds on If you do this you have to put it right at the edge of the foam so the clip doesnt get in the way when you fold it up I attach the little snack cup there and he helps himself as we ride alongAs far as the seat sliding back and forth  we just havent had any problem with this When my son wants to stand up its pretty convenient that he can push the seat back out of the way for himself He couldnt do this if it were snapped in placeSomebody else mentioned that folding it up was a hassle because the tray ended up on the ground Well not if you fold it up towards you All it takes is lifting up on the little locking lever on the side and then pulling up on the two finger pulls on either side of the push bar very simple As the stroller starts to bend just reach forward and pull the snack tray in front up towards you This keeps the rear wheels on the ground they automatically lock as you fold up the stroller which prevents the whole things sliding away from you  this is a great detail and then another little side clip locks the whole thing together Its really really easy if youre wondering Im only 55 so you dont have to be tall to comfortably do thisOpening it up is even easier Unlatch the locking clip and this isnt anything you have to struggle with it just rotates up and the whole stroller pops open The back wheels will still be locked so you dont have to do that before putting the kids in  again this is really nice  and just remember to relatch that other clip at the base of the push bar You dont even have to bend to do this you can do it with your footThe

24186,38.147633376822284,"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","[I got this stroller for my daughter prior to the birth of her first baby. Here's what she has to say about the B-Agile...]I would give 4.5 stars if I could. I have had the b-agile since my son was born almost eight months ago and, overall, we are very satisfied with this stroller. From my test drives of other strollers and watching my friends struggle with their more complex stroller systems, it seems that every stroller has some issues - but this stroller seems about as good as they come. We use it for long walks through the park, quick errands in the car, and when traveling. I originally wanted the Uppababy Vista - I liked the idea of the bassinet and the seat switching directions. I now know that I would have barely used either of these features and am thankful my father got us this stroller before we splurged on the Vista.Ok, the pros:- The weight. This thing is so light! I easily pull it out of the trunk with one hand when I have groceries or other items in the other.- The foldability. So easy. Hit the button, pull the handle. Love it and do it with one hand all the time. I hear that the safety button isn't on the city mini, so this is an advantage of the b-agile.- The ride/suspension are tops. Smooth and comfortable for baby and mom/dad. Works on all smooth services. Not so great on gravel and grass. Doesn't work on sand.- Maneuverability is great. Also, I believe that the wheel base is narrower than the city mini, so easier to move through tight spaces.- Nice giant canopy- Nice height of handle and walking clearance (I am 5'8, husband is 6')- The combo with the b-safe. This may be the biggest advantage over the city mini. The adaptors come with the stroller, click right into place, and the b-safe car seat snaps in with no effort. It is so easy! The adaptors are also very minimalist, so we just keep them on the stroller at all times and use them when we need them. The car seat adaptors for the city mini for many of the most popular car seats are big, bulky and have to be taken off for folding and, of course, using the stroller independent of the car seat. I know a couple friends that say their car seats are basically balancing on the city mini adaptor and don't feel secure at all. But on the b-agile, the b-safe feels completely solid and secure. I also didn't even think about getting a snap and go because this combo worked so well and, of course, you have all the benefits of an all-purpose stroller with great suspension. This also allowed baby, when tiny, to face me, which was really nice. Finally, the canopy of the b-safe and b-agile work together to cover baby completely when the car seat is installed. For people who really want a complete travel system, I can't imagine a better combo than this.- Contrary to what another review says, my b-agile does stand on its own when folded just fine.- Great travel stroller. Light enough, easy to fold, great travel bag (for purchase separately). One thing to know: you have to remove the car seat adaptors for loading into the travel bag, This isn't a problem for us and adds maybe 30 seconds on the jetway when we are folding our stroller for gate-checking.And the cons:- My brakes are sticky! This is my biggest complaint about this stroller. I frequently have to click and unclick the brakes three or four times for the brakes to release.- The under stroller storage area is a bit cramped. My diaper bag won't fit.- The wheels are hard plastic rather than foam filled. They seem to be holding up thus far, but we'll see...- The seat back doesn't get quite upright enough for my little one.- The unfold latch could be easier. Although the stroller is very light, I can't have baby in one arm, pull the stroller out of the trunk and unfold it. The unfold latch is a little difficult to operate and sometimes you think you've got it and it re-latches. You really need two hands to unfold the stroller - which I am fine with, but I know some folks love the idea of an instant unfold.Also, I bought the sunshine kids console to go with this stroller and it works great. I do not need to remove when folding.No stroller is perfect, but this one is pretty great. This is the only stroller we own and I haven't yet felt a need to get any other type of stroller (including an umbrella). This one fits the bill for a great all-around stroller.",4.0,I got this stroller for my daughter prior to the birth of her first baby Heres what she has to say about the BAgileI would give 45 stars if I could I have had the bagile since my son was born almost eight months ago and overall we are very satisfied with this stroller From my test drives of other strollers and watching my friends struggle with their more complex stroller systems it seems that every stroller has some issues  but this stroller seems about as good as they come We use it for long walks through the park quick errands in the car and when traveling I originally wanted the Uppababy Vista  I liked the idea of the bassinet and the seat switching directions I now know that I would have barely used either of these features and am thankful my father got us this stroller before we splurged on the VistaOk the pros The weight This thing is so light I easily pull it out of the trunk with one hand when I have groceries or other items in the other The foldability So easy Hit the button pull the handle Love it and do it with one hand all the time I hear that the safety button isnt on the city mini so this is an advantage of the bagile The ridesuspension are tops Smooth and comfortable for baby and momdad Works on all smooth services Not so great on gravel and grass Doesnt work on sand Maneuverability is great Also I believe that the wheel base is narrower than the city mini so easier to move through tight spaces Nice giant canopy Nice height of handle and walking clearance I am 58 husband is 6 The combo with the bsafe This may be the biggest advantage over the city mini The adaptors come with the stroller click right into place and the bsafe car seat snaps in with no effort It is so easy The adaptors are also very minimalist so we just keep them on the stroller at all times and use them when we need them The car seat adaptors for the city mini for many of the most popular car seats are big bulky and have to be taken off for folding and of course using the stroller independent of the car seat I know a couple friends that say their car seats are basically balancing on the city mini adaptor and dont feel secure at all But on the bagile the bsafe feels completely solid and secure I also didnt even think about getting a snap and go because this combo worked so well and of course you have all the benefits of an allpurpose stroller with great suspension This also allowed baby when tiny to face me which was really nice Finally the canopy of the bsafe and bagile work together to cover baby completely when the car seat is installed For people who really want a complete travel system I cant imagine a better combo than this Contrary to what another review says my bagile does stand on its own when folded just fine Great travel stroller Light enough easy to fold great travel bag for purchase separately One thing to know you have to remove the car seat adaptors for loading into the travel bag This isnt a problem for us and adds maybe 30 seconds on the jetway when we are folding our stroller for gatecheckingAnd the cons My brakes are sticky This is my biggest complaint about this stroller I frequently have to click and unclick the brakes three or four times for the brakes to release The under stroller storage area is a bit cramped My diaper bag wont fit The wheels are hard plastic rather than foam filled They seem to be holding up thus far but well see The seat back doesnt get quite upright enough for my little one The unfold latch could be easier Although the stroller is very light I cant have baby in one arm pull the stroller out of the trunk and unfold it The unfold latch is a little difficult to operate and sometimes you think youve got it and it relatches You really need two hands to unfold the stroller  which I am fine with but I know some folks love the idea of an instant unfoldAlso I bought the sunshine kids console to go with this stroller and it works great I do not need to remove when foldingNo stroller is perfect but this one is pretty great This is the only stroller we own and I havent yet felt a need to get any other type of stroller including an umbrella This one fits the bill for a great allaround stroller,1.0
29161,36.53949162630203,Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible 3-in-1 Baby Car Seat - Bridgebeam,"My dad just bought this car seat for me/my son as the next step after his infant carrier. He's large for his age and at 11 months it was time for us to ""upgrade"". My dad made the purchase at Sam's Club and the price was a lot lower than Amazon ... I love Amazon but wanted to put that out there as an FYI - if you have Sam's near you (or Costco - these seats are sold there as well), try there first to get a better price.So out the box, the first impression of the seat was that it seemed sturdy, easy to use and had minimal ""bells and whistles"" (with my Chicco KeyFit infant carrier I'm not used to bells and whistles so that's fine by me). I took it out in the living room and just started looking over the seat and reading through the manual to familiarize myself with all the features, how to adjust everything, how to recline the seat (love this feature!), etc. I tend to think some of the negative comments here may be due to skipping over this process? I feel it's a best practice to check out a product of this nature to make sure you have as much knowledge as possible before getting upset that it doesn't fit properly in your car. ... anyway ...After reviewing the seat, fiddling with the straps and the handy recline feature, and understanding the basics of installation, we took it to the car to test out the fit. My son is still REAR FACING so my review is based on that installation; I cannot yet speak to forward facing installation.My car only has LATCH in the center seat so that's where we installed the car seat (it's the safest spot anyway). My dad and I strapped it in together and it was relatively easy to install. The LATCH strap feeds across/under the seat cushion (same if you use seat belt installation), then you click in each of the 2 LATCH hooks and tighten the seat and you're done. However, this method didn't provide a very tight fit and we weren't completely comfortable leaving it that way. [NOTE: I have read that you should test the security of the seat installation by trying to move the seat *at the point of attachment (LATCH or seat belt)*, NOT at the back of the seat when rear facing (when a seat is installed rear facing, that part of the seat will always have more movement and it's not the most accurate test of a secure installation)].At that point, we decided to use the ""foam noodle technique"" to see if that could get the seat tighter. Plus the back seat of my car has a slight incline as I think most cars do, so even having the car seat in the fully reclined position (which is recommended in the manaul for rear facing installation), my son would have still been more ""upright"" than I'd like. So we got out a chunk of compressed foam to level out the seat base (about 4""x8"") and installed the carseat on top of that. It fit like a glove! The seat wasn't going anywhere - it was really tight and secure now; I was 110% pleased and confident with the installation and felt very secure and at-ease putting my son in the new car seat.As for the seat itself, I've seen a few comments here and elsewhere that say the fabric and the padding are inferior; I didn't get that impression at all. I feel like the seat is very comfortable and sufficiently padded. I like the inclusion of side impact protection at the head. The straps are also very easy to adjust and have soft pads at the shoulders. I haven't had to move the straps to different positions other than loosening or tightening; there are 3 positions for the buckle (the strap in the seat, not the harness straps) and the instruction manual seemed pretty straight forward if you need to make that adjustment. As for the harness straps, they are adjustable by simply raising and lowering the back of the seat with the little red levers at each side of the head rest. You twist in the handles and lift or lower the back of the seat and the shoulder straps move with it. So extremely easy. With my son strapped in, I feel he is very secure and the seat is the right size and shape for him. It's pretty simple to get the straps on him properly and he seems comfortable. I like that there is a small pillow included as well - kind of a nice feature for longer drives.I haven't yet taken the seat cushion completely off, but from what I can tell it seems like it would be pretty easy. Of course you'd have to deal with the harness straps which I think is the most difficult part of taking off any car seat cushion. The cover is attached with little elastic loops that hook onto the plastic seat base ... just taking off a few of those loops during the installation process and then reattaching them was pretty simple.The arm rests are really cool too. As my son gets bigger I'm sure he'll put them to more use, but for the now the option of easily folding them up is really nice. And the removeable cup holder is easy to use. Again, a feature better suited for an older child, but really nice to have.Overall I'm very pleased with this seat and the quality/safety/longevity for the price. I really couldn't beat it ... I've been looking for a car seat to replace the infant carrier for a while now and I just haven't found one that's a 3 in 1 seat for less than $150 or so (I had decided to get a convertible seat and then buy a booster once he outgrew that). Now that I have seen this seat in person and spent some time with it, I can say that I would pay $150 for it, but knowing I got it for $80.00 is even better. Such a steal. I definitely recommend this seat.",5.0,My dad just bought this car seat for memy son as the next step after his infant carrier Hes large for his age and at 11 months it was time for us to upgrade My

27522,35.415036046122296,"UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Denny","I researched strollers for months and months before my daughter was born.  I was debating between the city mini, a BOB, and the Uppababy.  The Uppababy was the most expensive out of the three, and I was very leery about spending $700 on a stroller.  That said, the Uppababy Vista is WORTH EVERY PENNY.I am a tall woman (5'9"") and often times handle bars on strollers are too short for me.  This one has three height levels and the highest one is plenty high enough for me.  The ride is smooth, the stroller is really easy to push and handles many different types of terrain.  Even though it's not an official jogging stroller, I've done some very low impact jogging with it on a track and it performed similarly to a BOB when used on a smooth surface (I've borrowed a BOB before from friends to run with).  I'm glad I didn't buy the BOB as my ""one stroller"" because the BOB doesn't have height adjustable handle bars.  Also the BOB has bulkier wheels and the baby can only face out.  On the Vista, you can position the seat so the baby is looking out, or looking in at you.  LOVE this option.  Also, the sunshield is HUGE and offers excellent UV protection.  This feature has been such a lifesaver during the summer.The basket underneath is so spacious.  During the early months, I used the car seat adapter and just put the car seat on top and used this stroller as a snap n' go.  It was so easy to fit tons of groceries in the bottom basket.  Super convenient because the car seat takes up like an entire shopping cart.While it's not as easy to fold up as the city mini, it's a better all around stroller.  I don't think it's difficult to fold up at all once you learn how to do it.  It fits just fine in the trunk of both my Toyota Camry and my husband's Volvo.I love, love, love the clean design and look of the stroller, and the color selections.  I chose the blue color for my daughter and love it.  It's totally a gender neutral blue and it brings out her pretty blue eyes!  My friend owns the black one and it looks sharp too.  Everyone I know who owns this stroller has been very happy with it.  I think you will be happy with it too.My ONLY complaint is that I wish it came with a cup holder.  I don't like having to shell out an extra $20 for a stupid cup holder.

23369,33.32045724642578,Baby Jogger 2011 City Select Stroller in Amethyst (Purple) With Second Seat,"I have the Baby Jogger City Select with Second Seat and I love it. No stroller is perfect, but of the doubles I've had (Maclaren Twin Tecno, Maclaren Triumph and Bob Duallie), this is my go-to everyday stroller because it is the narrowest, goes anywhere and folds compactly. If I had to do it over, this probably would have been my only stroller - I just wish I had known about it before buying the others!All these strollers can be used with my 8-month old twins and with my 41"" four year old preschooler but the City Select is the most useful one.PROS:* The City Select was named Baby Gizmo's 2010 Top Tandem stroller.* Goes anywhere - the reason I got it. I found out the hard way that side-by-sides do not fit between parked cars - the City Select does, with room to spare. This is the most important consideration when you're out and about with twins, so that you're not forced to leave one child alone in front of or behind your car while putting the other one in their car seat. The narrow width of the City Select has also been a huge advantage at doctor's offices, restaurants and stores that have narrower aisles.* Can be used from birth up. You can configure the City Select with optionalBaby Jogger Car Seat Adaptor City Select, Singlefor one or two babies (three types sold, some car seats fit better than others) or with one or two seats (place the heaviest child in the top position); it can have stadium seating facing forward (with a huge storage basket), or you can put both seats facing you so they can recline fully @ 180 degrees (better for babies, looks like bunk beds).* The three-part canopies are excellent and provide far more shade than most Maclaren strollers. A zip-in mesh backing can be zipped in front for additional sun shade when the sun is low (though the instructions don't say this). A clear peek-a-boo window with built-in mesh for shade on top has a flap with quiet magnetic close.* Total weight load recommended for this stroller is 45 lbs per seat(combined passenger and baggage weight), so calculate 90 lbs total max allowance with two seats. Max allowance for the basket is 15 lbs and for each seat pocket, 2 lbs. My 14 m babies are 22 & 21 lbs, the diaper bag is 8 lbs = 51 lbs. Still way under the limit.* Optional carrycots are sold separately.* The wheels work on many surfaces. I've been able to use the City Select on narrow paths, dirt, snow and grass. The City Selects pushes very easily on smooth surfaces, even with my 32 lb son. In comparison, the Bob Revolution Duallie is superior off-road and feels lighter to push, but is way too long to use indoors in smaller spaces. The Techno Twin and Triumph handle very well on smooth surfaces but are impossible to use in snow.* Very compact fold. The City Select takes up half the trunk of my minivan, standing up, with all three rows up. If I need more space in back, I simply stash the stroller & seats in the second row of the minivan. In comparison, the Bob Duallie takes up 3/4 of the cargo area in the minivan.

out and about with twins so that youre not forced to leave one child alone in front of or behind your car while putting the other one in their car seat The narrow width of the City Select has also

I didn't buy it at Babies R Us, but chose another vendor instead that offered free shipping and ended up costing a bit less.  I ordered the tower on 10/28/05 and it arrived 11/23/05, which wasn't a problem since I knew that Stork craft products tend to take awhile to ship, so I ordered early.  The box came in perfect condition and when we took it apart all the pieces where undamaged, in great condition and there was nothing missing.It took my mom and I (I am 5 months pregnant) an hour to put it together, the directions where easy to follow and the assembly was a piece of cake.  The only difficulty is to screw on the back panel.  There were a million screws, so have your electric screwdriver handy.  Also be careful with those screws the tolerances are very close and the wood is soft so is you don't screw them in just right you may end up with screws sticking out.  We simply redid them and now there are a few chips in the back of the tower, nothing to worry about.Upside* Looks absolutely amazing.  The wood is beautiful and shiny, the design is elegant and looks great in the room* The drawers are deep and allow for lots of storage.  Easy to take out and are finished with white on the inside for a very clean and appealing look.* The side cabinet is great.  Shelves can easily come out to allow for larger items to be stored.

22705,31.81884091665823,"UPPAbaby G-Luxe Stroller, Jake/Black","UPDATE: 2.5 years in and we still love it.  We have a new baby we are getting ready to use it on too.  Our eldest still loves riding it too.  It's just so comfortable, has such a great canopy, and has held up really well.  So happy we spent the money to get such a good stroller.  One thing I've noticed is that a lot of umbrella strollers are really short and parents hunch over when walking.  This is not the case with this one.  So much more comfortable since handles are at a good height for my 5'6"" frame and my husband's 6'1"" frame.UPDATE: 4 Months in and we still could not be happier with this stroller.  It works great and we have had zero problems.  Our daughter loves it too!We are absolutely in love with this stroller.  We looked at MANY strollers before deciding on this one.  I browsed on line for weeks, read reviews, and almost ordered a different one online before deciding I needed to see them in person.  We checked them all out.  I originally thought I'd get a cheap one (like $50 or less) but decided you really do get what you pay for.  Others, in the $100-$130 range just felt cheaper.  We finally narrowed it down between this one and the McLaren Triumph.  I had heard great things about the McLarens, but I wasn't as impressed in person.  They are pretty pricey and seemed to bulky, imo.  So we chose this one.Pros:- Steers/drives great.  Even though it's a two handle stroller, it pushes pretty well one handed--unlike most two handle strollers.- Reclines: this was important to us as our daughter is only 7 months old.  It's great when we are out shopping, she can easily lay back for a nap, or sit up if she wants to see what's going on.- Sunshade: It has an extendable UV blocker.  I love it for blocking the sun, but if it's windy, it also works as a great wind blocker since it can come down so far.  I have even used to to keep her a little more covered if she is sleeping while shopping.  Helps keep prying eyes (and hands) at a distance.- Harness:  Again, we needed a harness, not just a buckle.- Super light: It's only 11 pounds.  I can pick up with one-handed ease.- Stands up while folded: Not only does it fold easily (takes two-hands, but has a easy lift safety lock, and doesn't require your foot to help), but it stands while folded.- Unfolds easily: One simple handle opens on the left side to open, then you press down on the provided foot pedal to lock it in place.- Can stay with us for a long time: It's good quality and can hold up to 50 pounds (I think).  I have a feeling we will be using this well into toddler hood.- Nice material: very soft, doesn't feel cheapCons:- Price: On the pricier side of umbrella strollers, but like I said before, you get what you pay for.  It really is worth it in my opinion.- Basket is kind of small and a little hard to get to if the seat is reclined.  However, I found this to be true for just about every umbrella stroller I looked at.  Therefore, I didn't deduct for this.Lastly: We bought this one in early 2012.  I believe whatever problem people were having before has been fixed.  This one was not a part of that recall and we have not had a problem with it collapsing.",5.0,UPDATE 25 years in and we still love it  We have a new baby we are getting ready to use it on too  Our eldest still loves riding it too  Its just so comfortable has such a great canopy and has held up really well  So happy we spent the money to get such a good stroller  One thing Ive noticed is that a lot of umbrella strollers are really short and parents hunch over when walking  This is not the case with this one  So much more comfortable since handles are at a good height for my 56 frame and my husbands 61 frameUPDATE 4 Months in and we still could not be happier with this stroller  It works great and we have had zero problems  Our daughter loves it tooWe are absolutely in love with this stroller  We looked at MANY strollers before deciding on this one  I browsed on line for weeks read reviews and almost ordered a different one online before deciding I needed to see them in person  We checked them all out  I originally thought Id get a cheap one like 50 or less but decided you really do get what you pay for  Others in the 100130 range just felt cheaper  We finally narrowed it down between this one and the McLaren Triumph  I had heard great things about the McLarens but I wasnt as impressed in person  They are pretty pricey and seemed to bulky imo  So we chose this onePros Steersdrives great  Even though its a two handle stroller it pushes pretty well one handedunlike most two handle strollers Reclines this was important to us as our daughter is only 7 months old  Its great when we are out shopping she can easily lay back for a nap or sit up if she wants to see whats going on Sunshade It has an extendable UV blocker  I love it for blocking the sun but if its windy it also works as a great wind blocker since it can come down so far  I have even used to to keep her a little more covered if she is sleeping while shopping  Helps keep prying eyes and hands at a distance Harness  Again we needed a harness not just a buckle Super light Its only 11 pounds  I can pick up with onehanded ease Stands up while folded Not only does it fold easily takes twohands but has a easy lift safety lock and doesnt require your foot to help but it stands while folded Unfolds easily One simple handle opens on the left side to open then you press down on the provided foot pedal to lock it in place Can stay with us for a long time Its good quality and can hold up to 50 pounds I think  I have a feeling we will be using this well into toddler hood Nice material very soft doesnt feel cheapCons Price On the pricier side of umbrella strollers but like I said before you get what you pay for  It really is worth it in my opinion Basket is kind of small and a little hard to get to if the seat is reclined  However I found this to be true for just about every umbrella stroller I looked at  Therefore I didnt deduct for thisLastly We bought this one in early 2012  I believe whatever problem people were having before has been fixed  This one was not a part of that recall and we have not had a problem with it collapsing,1.0
24995,30.483451896183436,"Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","When I found out that I was expecting, I began researching all the baby products I wanted.  When it came to strollers I knew I wanted a 3 wheel stroller as they are more maneuverable.  I watched a video review of this stroller and decided that it was the one I wanted.  It was a bit pricey (almost as much as my crib!) but I figured it'd be worth the money.  And it sorta is.The things I love about it: it is so easy to push.  I can push it with one hand and even turn it with one hand.  It folds down easily.  I love the multiple seating positions.  My son is now 3 months old, so I've mostly used the laying down/flat position.  Now that he getting more control I've been able to raise it into a recline position so he can see out.  I like how there is a flap at the end to keep him safely inside when its in the flat position.  In fact, before I got my crib my son slept in the stroller (don't judge).  It worked great.  :D I love how the seat is cushioned so its comfortable and the straps are padded so its comfortable on his shoulders.  The straps are also easy to buckle.  I love the big basket at the bottom.  I live across the street from Target and am able to just take the stroller and carry my shopping bags in the basket on my way home.  I like that my Graco car seat can also snap in, though honestly I haven't used this feature.  I'm not sure I ever will but its nice to have the option.Things I don't love quite as much: the size.  Even when it is folded down it takes up most of my trunk space in my Honda Civic.  I haven't had the need yet to take it anywhere (because any long walking we use our infant carrier) but I'm worried about the size when I do. Also, I live on the 3rd floor so it is tricky getting it up and down the stairs.  It isn't heavy per say but it is big and awkward.  it takes two hands and I cant do that while holding a baby.  So when I want to take it out I have to have someone help me or stay in with the baby while I take it down. I also wasn't a huge fan of the price.  Like I said, it was almost as much as my crib.  Once I have another baby I'll have to get rid of it for a double and I'm wondering if it will be worth it.  Though it is pretty fancy, so the price is understandable.Overall, I love this stroller.  I love the way it feels when I push it.  It is like a hot knife through butter ;) I wish it weren't so big, but what can you do?

1169,30.440447278970954,Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,"2003 Review: I spent four weeks researching strollers before I finally bought this one for my six-month old. My research involved going to all of the product websites, reading customer reviews, stopping people with various strollers on the street, talking with friends, and trying them each out in the stores. I had been borrowing an infant car-seat/snap-and-go combo from a friend for the first six months of my daughter's life and knew what I liked and didn't like about that stroller. In a city where your primary means of transportation is walking, a good-quality, durable stroller is critical --so you do need to spend a bit more money.After seriously evaluating the Evenflo Comfort system, the Graco Metrolite, the Combi TravelSavvy, the Maclaren Volo & Techno, the Bertini M5, the Peg Perego Pliko and this one, I had pretty much narrowed it down to the Peg Perego Venezia and the comparably priced and ubiquitous MacLaren Techno because they were the most durable and easiest to handle of the lot. The MacLaren is lighter and folds up smaller, but only marginally so, and I am forever spotting little sleeping childeren umcomfortably slumped forward in their MacLarens like coach class passengers on an overnight flight: the MacLaren's seats don't fully recline; and that is important when you are on long strolls/shopping trips that run into nap-time. Kids in MacLarens just look less comfortable and cozy than those in the Peg Perego. So after much backing and forthing, I took the chance on the Peg Perego. I'm really glad I did.I had a feeling I'd made a stellar choice as soon as I took it out of the box.  I was able to assemble it without even looking at the instructions: unlike so many items I've bought for my baby, it's operation was perfectly intuitive. It rides like a cadillac on the treacherous New York City sidewalks (pot holes, ice lumps, gravely streets, ramp-less curbs) and handles so well I can steer it with one hand --as easily as the MacLaren. It's not quite as small when folded, but it folds up so compactly into a standing position that it stays out of the way in our cramped NYC digs. It also has plenty of storage space in the lower basket that can be accessed while the seat is fully reclined (storage space is critical to the carless Manhattan resident) and it has much more of it than the MacLarens have. Note also that storage space was a deal-breaker with the Peg Perego Pliko, too: it is completely inaccessible from above --you have to slip items under a metal frame from the side. The Venezia's adjustable handle is nice and high so that you don't have to stoop to walk with it (I'm 5'7""). It's as high as the one on the MacLaren Techno. I also love the bunting that allows it to be used as a cozy baby-carriage in the winter. Another cold-weather plus: the hood folds all the way down to to completely cover the baby in case of a sudden rain or windstorm. The Venezia fabric is by far the classiest and I've gotten many a compliment on it already. Sure, it would be nice to have a parent cup-holder, but the stroller handles so well  you can hold a cup in one hand and steer with the other --and it's probably a lot safer than having a cup of liquid positioned just over the baby's head. This is a great stroller, even for the price. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to the City-dweller.2005 Edit to this review: This stroller was great until my daughter was 18 months old. After that, it became too cumbersome to steer with the extra weight. I bought a MacLaren Volo and have used that one since. I would still use this stroller if I had another baby, but only for the first year and a half. I still recommend the Venezia, but I recommend buying the Volo when baby gets too heavy and/or when it doesn't need/can't fit in the wonderful bunting the Venezia offers.",5.0,2003 Review I spent four weeks researching strollers before I finally bought this one for my sixmonth old My research involved going to all of the product websites reading customer reviews stopping people with various strollers on the street talking with friends and trying them each out in the stores I had been borrowing an infant carseatsnapandgo combo from a friend for the first six months of my daughters life and knew what I liked and didnt like about that stroller In a city where your primary means of transportation is walking a goodquality durable stroller is critical so you do need to spend a bit more moneyAfter seriously evaluating the Evenflo Comfort system the Graco Metrolite the Combi TravelSavvy the Maclaren Volo  Techno the Bertini M5 the Peg Perego Pliko and this one I had pretty much narrowed it down to the Peg Perego Venezia and the comparably priced and ubiquitous MacLaren Techno because they were the most durable and easiest to handle of the lot The MacLaren is lighter and folds up smaller but only marginally so and I am forever spotting little sleeping childeren umcomfortably slumped forward in their MacLarens like coach class passengers on an overnight flight the MacLarens seats dont fully recline and that is important when you are on long strollsshopping trips that run into naptime Kids in MacLarens just look less comfortable and cozy than those in the Peg Perego So after much backing and forthing I took the chance on the Peg Perego Im really glad I didI had a feeling Id made a stellar choice as soon as I took it out of the box  I was able to assemble it without even looking at the instructions unlike so many items Ive bought for my baby its operation was perfectly intuitive It rides like a cadillac on the treacherous New York City sidewalks pot holes ice lumps gravely streets rampless curbs and handles so well I can steer it with one hand as easily as the MacLaren Its not quite as small when folded but it folds up so compactly into a standing position that it stays out of the way in our cramped NYC digs It also has plenty of storage space in the lower basket that can be accessed while the seat is fully reclined storage space is critical to the carless Manhattan resident and it has much more of it than the MacLarens have Note also that storage space was a dealbreaker with the Peg Perego Pliko too it is completely inaccessible from above you have to slip items under a metal frame from the side The Venezias adjustable handle is nice and high so that you dont have to stoop to walk with it Im 57 Its as high as the one on the MacLaren Techno I also love the bunting that allows it to be used as a cozy babycarriage in the winter Another coldweather plus the hood folds all the way down to to completely cover the baby in case of a sudden rain or windstorm The Venezia fabric is by far the classiest and Ive gotten many a compliment on it already Sure it would be nice to have a parent cupholder but the stroller handles so well  you can hold a cup in one hand and steer with the other and its probably a lot safer than having a cup of liquid positioned just over the babys head This is a great stroller even for the price I would recommend it to anyone but especially to the Citydweller2005 Edit to this review This stroller was great until my daughter was 18 months old After that it became too cumbersome to steer with the extra weight I bought a MacLaren Volo and have used that one since I would still use this stroller if I had another baby but only for the first year and a half I still recommend the Venezia but I recommend buying the Volo when baby gets too heavy andor when it doesnt needcant fit in the wonderful bunting the Venezia offers,1.0

Sure, carrying a stroller around can be a pain in the butt, but if you got a lot of shopping to get done it's actually rather nice to have! The problem with that though is where do you put the diaper bag? Oh, you get stuck carrying it... well not necessarily if you invest in The Mommy Hook.he Mommy Hook is the perfect stroller hanger. It's built to last, versatile and fits virtually all stroller handles. The Mommy Hook is made from durable, heavy-duty aluminum - it won't break like cheap plastic hangers. It's specifically designed so it will not slide. Just snap it on your stroller or shopping card and you're ready to roll. You can even use the Mommy Hook to carry bags from your car to your home.The Mommy Hook honestly reminds me of a jumbo version of my key ring I use. Of course that's definitely not to say I like it. I've had my keychain for a long time and I love it! The Mommy Hook I find to be very durable just as they describe. Since we don't have a stroller for the soon to be baby yet I tested it out using my purse and hanging it up rather than having it sit on the floor like it usually does. Well the purse is STILL hanging and nothing is broken so that's definitely a good sign.I find that the hook, while being super durable, is very easy to use with very little effort needed. I can easily push the hook open with one hand. I've seen other hooks the same size which require two hands from me to get a little nudge moved. Yea, I think I made my point on that. Also, I love the foam handle. Again, it's thick and durable, but makes holding the hook so much more comfortable than carrying it or using it by the metal. I honestly wish I would have had this when we lived in the apartment. Why? Because we lived on the 3rd floor with an elevator that rarely worked and my arms would be dead after carrying tons of bags of groceries up and down the stairs. This would have saved me a lot of pain and trips!Other than being used for the stroller you can use this to hang items in the garage, clip to a shopping cart, hang purses or other items around the house. It's not JUST for mommies and has many useful functions other than just holding mommy stuff as I pointed out. Would I recommend this? Oh definitely! I intend to use one to keep holding my purse and the other will stay in my car for those large grocery trips - just so I can be lazy!READ FULL REVIEW: http://www.closetsamples.com/review-giveaway-the-mommy-hook/",5.0,Tne thing I remember about when Sophia was a baby was the convenience of having a stroller to push her around in and the fact it would hold my purse and bags so I didnt have to Sure carrying a stroller around can be a pain in the butt but if you got a lot of shopping to get done its actually rather nice to have The problem with that though is where do you put the diaper bag Oh you get stuck carrying it well not necessarily if you invest in The Mommy Hookhe Mommy Hook is the perfect stroller hanger Its built to last versatile and fits virtually all stroller handles The Mommy Hook is made from durable heavyduty aluminum  it wont break like cheap plastic hangers Its specifically designed so it will not slide Just snap it on your stroller or shopping card and youre ready to roll You can even use the Mommy Hook to carry bags from your car to your homeThe Mommy Hook honestly reminds me of a jumbo version of my key ring I use Of course thats definitely not to say I like it Ive had my keychain for a long time and I love it The Mommy Hook I find to be very durable just as they describe Since we dont have a stroller for the soon to be baby yet I tested it out using my purse and hanging it up rather than having it sit on the floor like it usually does Well the purse is STILL hanging and nothing is broken so thats definitely a good signI find that the hook while being super durable is very easy to use with very little effort needed I can easily push the hook open with one hand Ive seen other hooks the same size which require two hands from me to get a little nudge moved Yea I think I made my point on that Also I love the foam handle Again its thick and durable but makes holding the hook so much more comfortable than carrying it or using it by the metal I honestly wish I would have had this when we lived in the apartment Why Because we lived on the 3rd floor with an elevator that rarely worked and my arms would be dead after carrying tons of bags of groceries up and down the stairs This would have saved me a lot of pain and tripsOther than being used for the stroller you can use this to hang items in the garage clip to a shopping cart hang purses or other items around the house Its not JUST for mommies and has many useful functions other than just holding mommy stuff as I pointed out Would I recommend this Oh definitely I intend to use one to keep holding my purse and the other will stay in my car for those large grocery trips  just so I can be lazyREAD FULL REVIEW httpwwwclosetsamplescomreviewgiveawaythemommyhook,1.0
17803,28.8411991252484,"Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller with Front Fixed Wheel, Fierce","OK first off - I want to say that I did a LOT of research before I purchased this stroller. Fixed wheel, swivel wheel - there are SO MANY models out there! I'm training for my first marathon & it gets dark here so early that I needed a good dependable jogging stroller to take my daughter in since it's usually too late when my husband gets home to go out!For those that have complained about the iBaby ""sound system"" not being loud enough - I honestly don't think it's necessarily meant for the runner. I plug in my old nano & have a playlist of kids music for my daughter - SHE LOVES IT! I wouldn't WANT it loud b/c of her little ears!  I have my phone with headphones on so I can play MY music & that's what works great for us.I honestly haven't tried the pedometer - I just kind of go & go & go - I track my route on google maps when I'm finished & that tells me how far I went.  Sorry I can't review that!The hand brake is VERY convenient - it's quite hilly here & I definitely use it coming down. It also has a wrist strap so I feel extra secure - I do like that feature a lot.  The handle adjusts so it works well for me at 5'5"" and my husband can adjust it to his 6'2"" frame.This is a JOGGING stroller - it's not meant to be a shopping stroller so for those who have marked down the reviews - honestly - this is NOT meant to shopping at Wal Mart! Graco makes a good stroller for that.  You definitely need a fixed wheel though for jogging.  I looked at a stroller that has a wheel that adjusts from fixed to swivel but when I read up on GOOD jogging strollers - they mentioned the importance of the SIZE of the wheels. The front wheel on the adjustable & swivel is always smaller.  These particular wheels are perfect for me - it's smooth & we just GO.I highly recommend this stroller for anyone looking at an affordable jogging stroller.  People like me who just can't spend $600 on a BOB.  Thanks Jeep!  Great stroller, great price & the weather shield fits on it perfectly! ;-)",5.0,OK first off  I want to say that I did a LOT of research before I purchased this stroller Fixed wheel swivel wheel  there are SO MANY models out there Im training for my first marathon  it gets dark here so early that I needed a good dependable jogging stroller to take my daughter in since its usually too late when my husband gets home to go outFor those that have complained about the iBaby sound system not being loud enough  I honestly dont think its necessarily meant for the runner I plug in my old nano  have a playlist of kids music for my daughter  SHE LOVES IT I wouldnt WANT it loud bc of her little ears  I have my phone with headphones on so I can play MY music  thats what works great for usI honestly havent tried the pedometer  I just kind of go  go  go  I track my route on google maps when Im finished  that tells me how far I went  Sorry I cant review thatThe hand brake is VERY convenient  its quite hilly here  I definitely use it coming down It also has a wrist strap so I feel extra secure  I do like that feature a lot  The handle adjusts so it works well for me at 55 and my husband can adjust it to his 62 frameThis is a JOGGING stroller  its not meant to be a shopping stroller so for those who have marked down the reviews  honestly  this is NOT meant to shopping at Wal Mart Graco makes a good stroller for that  You definitely need a fixed wheel though for jogging  I looked at a stroller that has a wheel that adjusts from fixed to swivel but when I read up on GOOD jogging strollers  they mentioned the importance of the SIZE of the wheels The front wheel on the adjustable  swivel is always smaller  These particular wheels are perfect for me  its smooth  we just GOI highly recommend this stroller for anyone looking at an affordable jogging stroller  People like me who just cant spend 600 on a BOB  Thanks Jeep  Great stroller great price  the weather shield fits on it perfectly ,1.0
14438,28.723422110855566,"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I just tried this hands free breastpump bra, and I have to say, I love it! I previously tried the Medela easy expression bustier and I wasn't very happy with it.  Being an ample chested woman to start with, and then adding engorged breasts to the mix, I found the Medela bra to be too constricting and hard to position the pump flanges. I finally gave up and was just holding the pump each time. Then I found a lifesaver, well timesaver is more accurate, I was so excited to finally get my Simple Wishes bra!  With the Simple Wishes bra, both of my problems are resolved.  I love the adjustable back panel so you are sure to get the perfect fit every time.  I also think the zip in front panel is a genius addition!  Not everyone has breasts that are spaced the same and a little extra comfort room is nice so you are not smashing your breasts together to make the flange holes line up with your nipples.  Also, the four panel flange hole is a great invention!  It allows you to adjust the flange to get the perfect fit and placement each time you pump without having to make major adjustments.  It also provides a nice firm support for the pump so that you don't break suction when you move around.  I also want to mention the optional bra straps.  I love that I can put straps on the bra for additional support.  With out the straps, the bra fits great and it is very comfortable and functions perfectly.  I added the straps just to see how it was, and it improves upon an already awesome product.  The straps provide extra lift to the whole bra so you don't feel like you are sagging.  (back to the Medela bra for a moment, when I did get everything positioned just perfectly, I felt like my breasts were sagging and it made me feel more like a frumpy milk cow instead of a loving mother who wants to provide her son with all the benefits of breastmilk, even when I am away). Let's face it ladies, no one likes to feel like their breasts are sagging!My lucky husband got to be witness to the first time I used this Simple Wishes bra. He probably thinks I am crazy, the way I was ranting and raving about how awesome this bra is.  I really can't say it enough, I love this bra, and it makes pumping so much easier and much more enjoyable!",5.0,I just tried this hands free breastpump bra and I have to say I love it I previously tried the Medela easy expression bustier and I wasnt very happy with it  Being an ample chested woman to start with and then adding engorged breasts to the mix I found the Medela bra to be too constricting and hard to position the pump flanges I finally gave up and was just holding the pump each time Then I found a lifesaver well timesaver is more accurate I was so excited to finally get my Simple Wishes bra  With the Simple Wishes bra both of my problems are resolved  I love the adjustable back panel so you are sure to get the perfect fit every time  I also think the zip in front panel is a genius addition  Not everyone has breasts that are spaced the same and a little extra comfort room is nice so you are not smashing your breasts together to make the flange holes line up with your nipples  Also the four panel flange hole is a great invention  It allows you to adjust the flange to get the perfect fit and placement each time you pump without having to make major adjustments  It also provides a nice firm support for the pump so that you dont break suction when you move around  I also want to mention the optional bra straps  I love that I can put straps on the bra for additional support  With out the straps the bra fits great and it is very comfortable and functions perfectly  I added the straps just to see how it was and it improves upon an already awesome product  The straps provide extra lift to the whole bra so you dont feel like you are sagging  back to the Medela bra for a moment when I did get everything positioned just perfectly I felt like my breasts were sagging and it made me feel more like a frumpy milk cow instead of a loving mother who wants to provide her son with all the benefits of breastmilk even when I am away Lets face it ladies no one likes to feel like their breasts are saggingMy lucky husband got to be witness to the first time I used this Simple Wishes bra He probably thinks I am crazy the way I was ranting and raving about how awesome this bra is  I really cant say it enough I love this bra and it makes pumping so much easier and much more enjoyable,1.0
4705,28.26943030482734,Zooper Twist Red Lightweight Umbrella Stroller - Everyday Line,"This is a wonderful stroller.  I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it, sight unseen.I ordered the red version, which is much snazzier in person than on the Amazon picture.It is fairly lightweight - much lighter than our Graco model, but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers, nice and sturdy.  But it folds up in an umbrella fashion, so it won't take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried, if necessary.It comes with neat things like a rain cover, sun shade, and cold weather boot.  The rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller's basket.The canopy has a window, provides lots of shade, and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day.  Coolest of all, it has a built in mesh pouch that doesn't take up any room but still manages to hold everything I need: sunscreen, hand sanitizer, wallet, keys, cell phone, and sunglasses.  It's stretchy mesh, so if you don't have anything it just lies flat against the hood.  But it does have a plastic lining, so it's waterproof!  Also, it zips, so your things can't fall out and aren't accessible to your two year old, either.The basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag, although a small bag would fit best, especially if you want to keep the boot in there.The best part is that everything is snazzy.  Everything looks nice, the materials feel great, and it's well designed.  The parts that should be removable/washable are.It's a snap to put together (took just a couple of minutes) and everything locks into place in a smart way.  It's very easy to fold and unfold.  Also, it reclines beautifully and easily, including into a totally upright position.  I became frustrated that my Graco model's most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old.The place where your child's legs hang down is neat.  It is adjustable, so it could stick straight out, hang down, or even flip up for a very little one (maybe to use with the boot?)...  Your kid won't get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees.It has the newer style which I notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in.  My Graco model (purchased last year) is such a complicated mess.  You attach two things together on one side, two things together on the other side, then connect each side into the center.  Arg!  My son almost always fussed by the time I'd finished.  Also, he was always sitting on one of the straps, which easily became twisted.  My husband STILL has not figured out how to do this quickly.  :)  So this is a big improvement.It's also comfy!  I can't vouch for that myself, of course.  But my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable.  With the Graco model, he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he wasn't tightly belted in he slouched down a lot.A few minor imperfections about the Zooper Twist.The cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle.  It works well for a standard water bottle or something, but one of those giant mall-sized beverages might not be so great.  You can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment, if that is important to you.This stroller is great for me - I'm 5'5.  It would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable.This isn't a jogging stroller.  It does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel, which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage.This isn't the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink, if you are looking for that kind of stroller.  There isn't a cup and snack tray for your child.  No clock.This is just the greatest stroller and I'm so glad to dump our awful Graco stroller.  Hated. that. thing.
